In the year of 2019, people are having more chances getting to know about some of the latest computer science trends or buzzwords through news and leaks of how user data stored on Facebook or Google server is breached yet again; examples are like ‘Big Data’ and ’Cloud’, or ‘Cryptocurrency’ and ‘5G’. However, these industrial-specialized terminologies are far from appealing or exciting to the crowds as many have given critiques: how massive tech giants are handling with personal data right now are essentially criminal activities. At the meantime, if considering from another point of view, those many who are unsure about what path to take for their future career might since that have a chance reviewing that whether advanced computer operation have already become a popular activity embedded in our daily routine and whether there is a thriving demand on those techniques and skills.  

In fact, it is not surprised that it has found that almost all employers in every industry, from IT to Real Estates, are continually seeking for new supplies for their information engineering departments, according to a survey conducted by Stack Overflow (“Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019”, 2019).

It is also worth mentioning that many countries are taking steps to cultivate programming as a necessary subject of teaching even starting before post-secondary education and raise the number of potential programmers as fast as possible; where some have chosen to do so by making programming course mandatory in secondary school curriculum. For instance, Japan has reported having passed a bill to make programming courses compulsory, starting in 2020 in middle school (Verma, 2016); Finland, which has been long keeping ahead of the computer science education in Europe, even designated programming a compulsory for primary school students since grade one, started fall 2016 (Toikkanen, 2015). However, as the research group in Aalto University emphasized on its blog that differs to other European countries, Finland’s programming requirement is not completed by taking a separate course, but by intuitively applying and combining coding skills with other subjects such as mathematics, as a new pedagogy that better foster students’ senses on thinking logically.  

Similar progresses are being made within Canada: coding is being added to the course curriculum in many secondary schools; which some have started several years earlier in Ontario, and some three years ago in B.C. (Silcoff, 2016).

From my point of view, Finland’s solution to its new course design theoretically serves an identical goal in comparison to the many interdisciplinary programs offred by computer science department in major post-secondary institutions: to take the full advantage of computer science skills and apply it to other subjects. In today’s university education, the trend of adding some ‘essential’ programming courses into non-related degree requirement is rapidly increasing and has recently reached its plateau. Even though many course designs for such purposes are still under-refined no matter it is online or on-site, educators should not discard offering non-major programming courses for the potential ample benefit that it can bring to the students.

Programming and computer science related courses are becoming a big portion in students’ undergraduate studies, especially for STEM students. Although some are all aware that they would be involved in some sort of programming beforehand because they have chosen to pursue an interdisciplinary degree combining computer science and other fields; complications of the course contents could still be too much beyond their expectations and offset their passion in the course. Unreasonable course difficulty in particular, is a key factor that affects student performance which will be varied by different programming languages used on lectures. Programming languages which are popular but hard to master are like C and C++; those which shown to be  stayed in a medium-level difficulty or are considered beginner-friendly are examples like Java and Python. In a case study of designing a non-major computing course launched at Georgia Institute of Technology, the researchers Guzdial and Forte “settled on Python — in particular, the Python dialect, implemented in Java…” (Guzdial & Forte, 2005, p. 363) as they discovered that starting from Python, which uses less code to achieve the same functionality compared to other three languages, might be an optimal plan for beginners. Also, they indicated that courses designed like this are best prepared for CS minors and freshman non-majors; which means for those who are in the interdisciplinary majors, most still have to take standard-level courses like what computer science students would be required to.

One of my friends has given me an anecdote of how another friend of his, who is in the chemical engineering discipline and has been through a tough situation when taking an introductory programming course online in 2017 from a post-secondary institution in BC. According to his words, a typical entry-level computer science course actually covers more pure theoretical computer science materials than practical programmings, and the programming part is just as hard as what normal CS-major students would go through: from binary representation, logic gate, assembly language, to C language. Progressive course design like such is very CS major-oriented therefore the course forces students to input full effort or interest so they do not get overwhelmed by their grades or mental stress. A rough and course design alike usually diminishes the course’s original goal — making the use of the skills but not simply going over course materials.

Admittedly, the course design for non-major programming is not yet comprehensive for no matter one single course or courses taken through the entire program, no matter distance or on-campus learning style. Nevertheless, the methodology of interdisciplinary education is still being proved to be feasible and highly-productive.

In recent days, university departments are facing challenges to balance the course difficulty for non-CS major students though still striving to generate the best results. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria is one example which aims to bring the most synergy to its interdisciplinary programs by collaborating with other departments and offering co-op opportunities. Despite applicants are from several ‘seemingly unrelated’ disciplines: psychology, fine arts, music; plus that their general knowledge toward programming is limited, the Computer Science Department clarifies the rationale for taking such a move: for instance, students in the psychology discipline have many concrete options for future careers such as “designing effective user interfaces for software/hardware, for understanding and working with artificial intelligence, in methods of biological perception, and in determining neural modes of computation” (“Interdisciplinary programs – University of Victoria.”, 2019).

Either the student who have chosen to enroll in a combined program which involves programming, or the student who take non-major programming courses as electives is only interested in the fact that to what extent do the programming skills learned can become a useful tool in the way of solving problems in their original areas of study? Academically, these programmers are usually classified as the conversational programmers (Guo et al., 2015) or the application programmers (Haynes & Mudgett, 2016). In the study conducted by Haynes and Midgett, they identified and acknowledged that:  

    1.Non-CS programmers usually lack obvious motivation for taking any computer science related courses;  

    2.Non-CS programmers are often application programmers who only write software for a real- life task, which means they want to be more practical on the subject, not to discourse it. (Sec. II, B)

The two pieces of conclusions all add weight to one point: non-CS programmers should take the most chances implementing the programming skills as they encounter problems in their own fields of study, as the sole way to make their interdisciplinary learning productive. While as it has been asked for how, there are tons of examples that have shown how computer science and programming knowledge actually fulfill their purposes for non-major programmers: In a study held at the Simon Fraser University, which by putting both graduate and undergraduate into a research program on the modeling of Complex Social Systems, and using computer technology as the major tool,  the research team concluded that such collaboration had increased “mutual understanding between computer science majors and non-majors”, as well as boosted the number of papers published (Dabbaghian, Reid, & Giabbanelli, 2012, p. 51). In the humanities discipline, researchers also received meaningful and positive outcomes that students had better engage in the Gothic novel study through quantitative analysis and computational problem-solving, after implementing computer science concepts into English literature teaching, despite the students were all in English majors with almost zero programming experience (Brylow, Czarnik, & Bort, 2015). Many more uses of programming skills for non-CS purposes also include:”

    1.         Accessing NASA data on exoplanets and stars (astronomy)

    2.         Creating graphs and visualizing data (psychology, astronomy, physics, economics)

    3.         Creating virtual physics demonstrations and models (physics)     

    4.         Use Data Mining on the web for scientific research data (biology, psychology)”

General computing courses are certainly bringing benefits to its students, as the course is being well-designed, and the students could have perceived the importance of using basic programming skills to manage some pragmatic approaches before diving into any programming language without hesitation. Anastasia Salter, who is an assistant professor of digital media at the University of Central Florida and the author of an insightful blog article posted on The Chronicle of High Education website (Salter, 2011), addressed contemporary computing learning as ‘digital literacy’ and ‘code-literacy’. Furthermore, by examining Douglass Rushkoff’s Program or Be Programmed, she points out that it is especially vital to distinguish ‘knowing to code’ and ‘understanding code’ in this digital era; despite the former practice is being so prevailing among common job-seekers.
