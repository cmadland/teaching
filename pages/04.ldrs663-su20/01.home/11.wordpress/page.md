It is second nature to most to take selfies, share them on Instagram, Snapchat, etc., but once you move into the role of a public school teacher or within any public body, you must adhere to the laws set out by the B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner for public bodies (private organizations have a different set of rules). Their office has put together guidelines for you to follow to better understand what the rules are and how to get consent, which is detailed on page 4:

BC Cloud Computing Guidelines (PDF)

and you can review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act here.

Each school district will have their own process (which may range from not allowing to an expectation to integrate networked learning tools from outside of Canada), so it is important to understand your school context. That said, you may find some school administrators or staff breaking these rules or not aware of them. As a teacher, it is important for you to enter the field and uphold the law, regardless of the culture you enter. This does not mean that you do not engage online or outside of Canada. It means that if/when you do so, that you understand the steps, which are not much more complex than the consent you would get normally for going “on the Internet,” as is described in most schools, but you must name the date consent is effective and, if applicable, the date it expires. It is important that you work with your school district on the consent process. You can see an example of how school district are addressing access to cloud tools outside of Canada here (Coquitlam) and here plus here (Victoria). You must also name each tool individually. It cannot be “blogging.” You must name WordPress.com or Blogger, etc. If you use Flipgrid, you must name Flipgrid. Consent must also be informed, so effort must be taken to ensure that those signing consent understand the implications – that their data may leave Canada, how it may be harvested, and to know about the U.S. Patriot Act. One archived resource by the Canadian Treasury Board provides significant detailed information about the Patriot Act here. It is important to also review section 4(b) of the B.C. Digital Literacy Framework.

Some competencies for you to explore and ask if you need help:

    Is aware of the OIPC, FIPPA, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines and follows them
    Understands what constitutes personal information
    Understands that privacy online is a personal choice and must be respected
    Understands that, as a preservice teacher or inservice teacher in the schools, that you assume a “public body” hat and have a duty of care for your learners, their parents and families, and your colleagues with regard to their privacy and protection of personal information
    Is aware that the Canadian federal government states that the chances are remote that the US Patriot Act will access personal information of Canadians, but recognizes that it is our responsibility to protect privacy preferences and to ensure that consent obtained is informed consent. Some families may be involved with restraining orders and need to be private for their safety, but the reasons for privacy may be preference. Either way, it is not our business as to the reasons for privacy preferences, but it is our responsibility to uphold preferences.
    Understands how media moves through networks into US cloud-based services (e.g., back-ups on iTunes, syncing with Dropbox, messages with personal information sent on Gmail, blog RSS subscriptions, etc.)
    Understands that these acts do not prohibit participation in networked tools outside of Canada and many school districts are in need of teachers who model networked literacy and positive citizenship online for their learners
    Is familiar with section 4(b) of the BC Digital Literacy Framework and is prepared to integrate it in teaching and learning
    Understands what appropriate consent looks like for public bodies and is aware of what alternative steps are to support learners when consent is not obtained.
