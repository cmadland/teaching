I've completed responding to each of you in Forum 1 in CourseSpaces, and before I continue, I want to thank you all for the work you put into that. You all did well and what I have to say in this post does not in any way reflect on you or the work that you did.

The content that formed the basis of Forum 1 was good. Tony Bates is a well-established scholar and researcher in distributed learning and has been for decades. He has been and continues to be very influential and respected in the field. If you are going to understand distributed learning in Canada, you are going to read Bates.

However, the nature of the task that I asked you to do was less than ideal. Essentially, I asked you to provide a definition, some commentary on your opinion, and then ask a question for someone else in the class to comment on. This is pretty standard fare for a lot of online courses, and it was awful to read. [Again, not because of any deficiencies in your work, but because of the structure of the task.]

What ended up happening is that I received 43 posts, virtually all of which began with the exact same definition from the reading [go look, you're all very good students], followed by some opinions, and a variety of questions. The questions you asked were really good questions, and they were the most interesting part of your posts, because they go to what `you` want to know about the topic, rather than what `I` want you to know.

In the end, you all told me what I wanted you to tell me (as requested), even though I already knew the answer to my own question. So you were telling me stuff that I already knew. How dull.

I hope that over the duration of the rest of the course, you will be asking more questions. I am happy to provide the stems of ideas and sketch out problems and difficulties, but it will be `you` in your Learning Pods asking questions and working through answers with each other, then sharing your responses with 'the public' `who don't know the answers to these questions`. That way, you will be contributing to knowledge in the world and helping people to understand distributed and open learning better (even if it is only your mom reading your blog...), rather than telling me what I already know.

And, yes, Forum post 1 was intentionally designed to be dull and pedantic. I apologize.
