Did you see the reminder above? It's important.

### Showcase Post (35%)

!!! Your showcase post is your second graded assignment in EDCI 339 and is worth 35% of your final grade.

By now, you should have published four posts on your blog for each of the last four units. If you haven't completed these four posts, please do so now. `These posts are required.`

Your task for the Showcase Post is to choose `one` of those previous four posts to share with the class and with me for assessment. Before you do that, you need to make sure that it is polished and ready for publication, by `addressing any grammatical or spelling errors`, ensuring that you `link to all sources` (you don't need to use APA or MLA), and `revising anything that was unclear`.

Also, you should expand your post to be around 750 words by adding ideas you have encountered since you published the original, reflecting on how your thinking might have changed or how you might change your practice as an educator.

#### Task Summary

:fa-check: Address grammatical and spelling errors.  
:fa-check: Clarify explanations and ideas.  
:fa-check: Link to all sources.  
:fa-check: Reflect on how your thinking has changed.
