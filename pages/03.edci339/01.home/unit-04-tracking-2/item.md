#### One final activity for you to consider.

:fa-book: Please read [A Guide to Resisting EdTech](https://criticaldigitalpedagogy.pressbooks.com/chapter/a-guide-for-resisting-edtech-the-case-against-turnitin/).

<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://criticaldigitalpedagogy.pressbooks.com/chapter/a-guide-for-resisting-edtech-the-case-against-turnitin/">An Urgency of Teachers</a>

In Blog Post 1, each of you identified some educational tools on the web that you could use to engage learners in various modalities, and as you learned in Stommel's chapter, above, EdTech companies are not at all innocent of engaging in surveillance for profit.

Pick one of those tools and have a look at the Terms of Service (ToS). You can use [Bill Fitzgerald's outline](https://funnymonkey.com/2018/privacy-postcards-or-poison-pill-privacy) to evaluate the ToS. You don't need to do a full assessment, but see if you can learn some things about how the apps or tools you identified treat learner data.

### Blog Post #2

You've read and viewed a lot about data and privacy in technology in general and educational technology specifically. What stands out to you? Use one or more of the activities you explored to inspire Blog Post #2.
