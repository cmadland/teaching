By now you should have signed up for a WordPress site and sent me the URL through the form in the Unit 3 link in the [course hub](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339).

Once you have done that, it is time to do some reading on the different pedagogy and power structures in online learning.

The book you need to use is available through the UVic Library as an e-book, so, still, there is no need for you to purchase anything.

Please read pages 88-105 in the ebook. You will need to sign in to the UVic library to view the book.
