As you know by now, the remainder of EDCI 339 will be run from this site in WordPress. Please bookmark this site for easy reference.

Updates will show up on this page, with the newest update always at the top of the list.

You can find the content and activities for each unit by tapping 'Units' in the menus bar, then the unit that you are currently working on. Please work through the pages in each unit in numerical order.

Your work in the rest of the course will happen on your own blog that you will set up in Unit 3. It is very important that you get to work on this as soon as possible so that we can work through any difficulties you may encounter.
