`Open` is a word with a multitude of different meanings depending on the context...as below.

In an educational context, as in `open education`, the word `Open` has a more precise meaning, although there is certainly room for debate and discussion.

One of the definitions provided by Oxford is

> With no restrictions on those allowed to participate.
> ‘open discussion meetings’
> ‘each horse had won two open races’

This is the definition that most closely aligns with Irvine's `Multi-Access Learning` model that we discussed in Unit 3.
