`Open` is a word with a multitude of different meanings depending on the context...as below.

<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/open">open | Definition of open in English by Lexico Dictionaries</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

In an educational context, as in `open education`, the word `Open` has a more precise meaning, although there is certainly room for debate and discussion.

One of the definitions provided by Oxford is

> With no restrictions on those allowed to participate.
> ‘open discussion meetings’
> ‘each horse had won two open races’

This is the definition that most closely aligns with Irvine's `Multi-Access Learning` model that we discussed in Unit 3. Recall that the four tiers of access in that model are face-to-face synchronous, remote synchronous, remote asynchronous, and open. The open tier of access is for learners who join the course and participate in the activities, but are not formally registered for credit.

As you might imagine, however, it goes deeper than that. It might be helpful to think about open education being related to one or more of the following categories of openness.

### Open `Participation`

This refers to tier four of the multi-access learning model, where barriers to participation are either lowered or removed altogether. Thompson Rivers University Open Learning is an example of a school that has lowered the barriers to participation by not requiring any prerequisites for the vast majority of their courses. They also offer some courses open on the web, like EDCI 339 is open on the web.

### Open `Permissions`

This aspect of openness is related to the license on the materials that are used in a course. If you scroll to the bottom of Jesse Stommel's article, you will see that it is shared under a `Creative Commons` license. tapping on the link in the license will take you to the following page which details the freedoms that you may exercise in relation to the content.

<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons - Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International - CC BY-NC 4.0</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

An open license allows end users (learners, faculty, anyone) to exercise five freedoms in relation to the content, known as the `5Rs`. An end user is free to retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute the material as long as they follow the specific guidelines of the license.

##### Defining the "Open" in Open Content and Open Educational Resources

The terms "open content" and "open educational resources" describe any copyrightable work (traditionally excluding software, which is described by other terms like "open source") that is either (1) in the public domain or (2) licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities:

    - Retain - the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
    - Reuse - the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
    - Revise - the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
    - Remix - the right to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
    - Redistribute - the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)

##### Legal Requirements and Restrictions Make Open Content and OER Less Open

While a free and perpetual grant of the 5R permissions by means of an "open license" qualifies a creative work to be described as open content or an open educational resource, many open licenses place requirements (e.g., mandating that derivative works adopt a certain license) and restrictions (e.g., prohibiting "commercial" use) on users as a condition of the grant of the 5R permissions. The inclusion of requirements and restrictions in open licenses make open content and OER less open than they would be without these requirements and restrictions.

There is disagreement in the community about which requirements and restrictions should never, sometimes, or always be included in open licenses. For example, Creative Commons, the most important provider of open licenses for content, offers licenses that prohibit commercial use. While some in the community believe there are important use cases where the noncommercial restriction is desirable, many in the community strongly criticize and eschew the noncommercial restriction.

As another example, Wikipedia, one of the most important collections of open content, requires all derivative works to adopt a specific license - CC BY SA. MIT OpenCourseWare, another of the most important collections of open content, requires all derivative works to adopt a specific license - CC BY NC SA. While each site clearly believes that the ShareAlike requirement promotes its particular use case, the requirement makes the sites' content incompatible in an esoteric way that intelligent, well-meaning people can easily miss.

Generally speaking, while the choice by open content publishers to use licenses that include requirements and restrictions can optimize their ability to accomplish their own local goals, the choice typically harms the global goals of the broader open content community.
##### Poor Technical Choices Make Open Content Less Open

While open licenses provide users with legal permission to engage in the 5R activities, many open content publishers make technical choices that interfere with a user's ability to engage in those same activities. The ALMS Framework provides a way of thinking about those technical choices and understanding the degree to which they enable or impede a user's ability to engage in the 5R activities permitted by open licenses. Specifically, the ALMS Framework encourages us to ask questions in four categories:

    - Access to Editing Tools: Is the open content published in a format that can only be revised or remixed using tools that are extremely expensive (e.g., 3DS MAX)? Is the open content published in an exotic format that can only be revised or remixed using tools that run on an obscure or discontinued platform (e.g., OS/2)? Is the open content published in a format that can be revised or remixed using tools that are freely available and run on all major platforms (e.g., OpenOffice)?
    - Level of Expertise Required: Is the open content published in a format that requires a significant amount technical expertise to revise or remix (e.g., Blender)? Is the open content published in a format that requires a minimum level of technical expertise to revise or remix (e.g., Word)?
    - Meaningfully Editable: Is the open content published in a manner that makes its content essentially impossible to revise or remix (e.g., a scanned image of a handwritten document)? Is the open content published in a manner making its content easy to revise or remix (e.g., a text file)?
    - Self-Sourced: It the format preferred for consuming the open content the same format preferred for revising or remixing the open content (e.g., HTML)? Is the format preferred for consuming the open content different from the format preferred for revising or remixing the open content (e.g. Flash FLA vs SWF)?

Using the ALMS Framework as a guide, open content publishers can make technical choices that enable the greatest number of people possible to engage in the 5R activities. This is not an argument for "dumbing down" all open content to plain text. Rather it is an invitation to open content publishers to be thoughtful in the technical choices they make - whether they are publishing text, images, audio, video, simulations, or other media.

### Open `Pedagogy`

When faculty use openly licensed materials, or they empower learners to `produce` openly licensed materials, often with an end goal of promoting social justice for marginalized people, they might be considered to be engaging in open pedagogy (Hegarty, 2015; Lambert, 2019). The assigned readings for this unit, talk specifically about open pedagogy.

### Open `Platforms`

You may have noticed that Wiley's description of open content refers to the nature of the platform used to publish the material. If the platform is not open, or somehow prevents end users from exercising their 5R freedoms, then it is difficult to consider the material to be truly open. An example of an open platform would be Wikipedia, where anyone with access to a connection to the internet and sufficient bandwidth and computing power can edit and revise content. Compare this to a PDF document, which is very difficult to revise.

### Open `Policies`

This final category of openness is related to institutional policies that encourage openness in one or more of the preceding categories. An example of this is Kwantlen Polytechnic University which has developed a set of policies that encourage faculty to use and produce open textbooks and other materials in their courses and programs. KPU (as of this writing) has identified six full credentials students may complete with zero textbook costs. They call these programs `Z-Cred` (pronounced 'zed-cred' because we are in Canada!) indicating that there are zero required textbook costs.
