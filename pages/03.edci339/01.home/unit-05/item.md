#[plugin:content-inject](_important-reminders)

Hello everyone! Over the next couple of days, I'm going to introduce you to some of my favourite community-building tools.

### Slack

Hopefully by now, you have considered whether you want to sign up for Slack. I sent an invitation in Friday's email and also posted it under 'About --> Links' on the course site.

!! Just a reminder that Slack will store your email address and name (or pseudonym) on US servers.

I use Slack for a whole bunch of organizations, including my team at work, the EdTech Community in BC, my PhD work, and other organizations. I like it because it can be both synchronous or asynchronous, there are desktop and mobile apps, you can make calls right from the app, and it's not as formal as email.

Hope you are able to drop by and join the conversation!

### Hypothes.is

Another tool I'd like to introduce today is called [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is).

!! hypothes.is will store your email, name, and annotations on US servers. I trust them, but you are not required to give them your information.

Hypothes.is is a tool that allows people to add comments and notes to a public webpage, and create a conversation around the content in context.

Here are instructions for getting started.

<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://teaching.madland.ca/hypothesis">Hypothes.is</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

Once you have a group created, all of the annotations for that group are shown on one page, allowing the community/group to see what conversations are happening.

<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://hypothes.is/groups/GpwzVGQi/edci339-summer19">edci339-summer19 | Hypothesis</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

I strongly recommend that you use hypothes.is to create a private group for your Learning Pod, and use that to annotate each other's blogs for asynchronous feedback.

### Twitter

The little elephant-bird in the room!

!! Again, Twitter will store your info on US servers, and they are going to give you ads.

I have a love/hate relationship with Twitter. For those who don't know, Twitter is a 'micro-blogging' service where each post is limited to 280 characters (not words, characters). One of the best things about Twitter is that you can curate who you follow so that your feed shows you stuff that `you` are interested in. You can also `mute` words so Tweets with that word won't show up in your timeline. And you can `block` people from following you or seeing your Tweets.

Another good thing about Twitter is that you can follow along with certain topics or conversations without signing up for an account.

For example, if you want to see what I've been tweeting, just go to [https://twitter.com/colinmadland](https://twitter.com/colinmadland) and have a look. If you want to follow the hashtag #edtecuvic, you can do that too at [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23edtechuvic&src=typeahead_click&f=live](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23edtechuvic&src=typeahead_click&f=live).

Give it a try, go to [Twitter](https;//twitter.com) and search for people who are known influencers in your discipline and see what they are tweeting about. Or, to check out what's happening in education, try following some of these accounts:

- @_valeriei
- @mpaskevi
- @coursosa
- @hypervisible
- @ChristineYH
- @etug
- @remikalir

Or some of these hastags:

- \#edtechuvic
- \#tiegrad
- \#bcedchat
- \#AnnoConvo
