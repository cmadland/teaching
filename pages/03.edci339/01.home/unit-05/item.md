### Slack

Hopefully by now, you have considered whether you want to sign up for Slack. I sent an invitation in Friday's email and also posted it under 'About --> Links' on the course site.

!! Just a reminder that Slack will store your email address and name (or pseudonym) on US servers.

I use Slack for a whole bunch of organizations, including my team at work, the EdTech Community in BC, my PhD work, and other organizations. I like it because it can be both synchronous or asynchronous, there are desktop and mobile apps, you can make calls right from the app, and it's not as formal as email.

### Hypothes.is

Another tool I'd like to introduce today is called [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is).

!! hypothes.is will store your email, name, and annotations on US servers. I trust them, but you are not required to give them your information.

Here are instructions for getting started.

<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

Once you have a group created, all of the annotations for that group are shown on one page, allowing the community/group to see what conversations are happening.
