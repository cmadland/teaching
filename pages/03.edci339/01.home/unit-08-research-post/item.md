### Research Blog Post - 1500 words - 50%

Your major project for EDCI339 is your Research Blog Post. 

Your post should be about 1500 words and written in `academic style`, meaning that you must cite your sources according to APA or MLA, (or another academic style, as long as you use it consistently), and include a reference list at the end of your post.

There are several suggested topics listed below, and you may use the topic that you addressed in your `Showcase Post`.

- Inclusive design and accessibility in online learning,
- Online Corporate Training,
- Open Education,
- State of MOOCs,
- online training in your field,
- K12 online learning,
- specific open courses (DS106, ANTH101, Phonar),
- open textbooks,
- surveillance capitalism, data, and privacy,
- open education resources (including textbooks),
- social learning communities

### Suggested Structure

I `suggest` that you follow the structure outlined below to compose your post.

1. Introduction to the question or problem.
2. Brief review of the literature. (3-5 scholarly articles)
3. Discussion of the question or problem in light of the literature.
4. Summary, conclusions, and recommendations.
5. Finally, include a brief reflection (2-3 sentences) on the value of your Learning Pods and Partners in influencing your thinking.

#### Timeline
