Just a couple updates for this first week!

===

Thank you to those who have registered for a blog site. It looks like about half of you so far have decided to sign up at WordPress.com and the other half with UVic. Either one is ok.

If you have set your blog to be private, I won't be able to syndicate your posts automatically to the course site. Please make sure that you add a link to the appropriate assignment dropbox in CourseSpaces for each required post (your first post is due Sunday, May 19).

Also, please get in the habit of using the category `edci335` on each of your posts. [Click here for instructions for creating categories and applying them to your posts.](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/getting-started-with-wordpress/) Let me know if you need assistance!
