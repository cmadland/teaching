# Welcome!

Hello everyone, and welcome to EDCI 335, *Learning Design*.

I'm looking forward to spending the next few months with you talking about how to design learning experiences for learners using digital technologies.

## Getting started

To begin, please carefully read the syllabus for this course, which will be emailed to you. The syllabus is the official document that outlines what you will learn (outcomes), how you will demonstrate your learning, and how your grade will be determined (assessments). It also includes links to important University policies such as Academic Integrity, the use of editors, sexualized violence, and resources for learners with learning challenges.

! You are responsible for reading and understanding the syllabus. If you have a question about the course, please check the syllabus first, and if you can't find your answer there, check the course website and your learning pod, and if you still can't get an answer, feel free to reach out to me.

Make sure you spend a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout of this site so that you know where to find the information that you will need.
