[plugin:content-inject](../_week-2)


Good morning from rainy Richmond!

I've been through each of your self-introduction posts and thoroughly enjoyed meeting you all. I encourage you to jump into the [A01 Blog Feed](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-blog-feed/) in the menu and read about who else is in this section.

One of the great advantages of sharing your posts in public is that you are able to share with your family at home as well and also reach out to people who might be influencing you.

### Future posts

Here are some things to keep in mind generally about using a blog for learning.

:fa-check: Make sure you link to your sources. Even if this isn't formal academic writing, it is still important to acknowledge where you get your ideas. The easiest way to do that is through an [inline link](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-on-how-to-add-a-link-in-wordpress/#linkvisualeditor). If you want to embed a link to a WordPress site, like on our [Blog List page](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-blog-list/) all you need to do is paste the link to the site on its own line, but do not create a hyperlink. It will embed automagically.<br>
:fa-check: Remember to use the category `edci335`.<br>
:fa-check: Read each other's posts and respond to them by including links in your own posts. <br>
:fa-check: Confirm that your post is showing up on the [A01 Blog Feed](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-blog-feed/) page. Keep in mind that it may take an hour or so to refresh.  
:fa-check: [Include an interesting image as the featured image on your post.](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/image-sources-and-creative-commons/) You are also encouraged to use your own photos if you'd like.


### Learning Pods

Many of you have [signed up for a learning pod](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-social-spaces/), but there are still several who have not. Please make sure that you do this as soon as possible. The learning pods are a critical component of the course design for EDCI335.

- they are your best source of community and connection throughout the course;
- they are your teammates for the major assignments;
- they are your first source of assistance with questions about the course;
- they are your peer reviewers for your blog posts...

I have created another column in the learning pod sign-up sheet to indicate students who have dropped the course, so you don't need to stress about tracking them down to confirm their participation.

!!! Please meet with your learning pods as soon as possible! You can use any tool you would like, but [Zoom is available for all UVic learners.](https://uvic.zoom.us/)

### Learning Design Blueprint
As you know, [your blueprints are due June 14](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/learning-design-blueprint/). That may seem like a long time from now, but keep in mind that everything takes longer when you are working with a remote team. It is not too early to get started!

This is your first major assignment for the course and it is worth 20% of your final grade. It will be important for you to complete this assignment and submit it prior to submitting your major project, the `Interactive Learning Resource`. I encourage you to contact me with your questions! I'm here to help you succeed, and the sooner you get your questions answered, the better you will be able to plan your work.

Your blueprint is the planning stage for your learning resource, but don't worry about locking yourself in. Learning design is an iterative process and you will always be going back to adjust your plan as things change.

I'm available by email, text, or Slack (details on the syllabus) if you have questions.
