#### Things completed...

:fa-check: 4 blog posts [responding to the writing prompts](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/category/prompts/). Note that you must complete all 4 posts! I will be checking, and will ask that you complete them all if you haven't yet done so.  
:fa-check: 1 [Peer review post](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/peer-review/).  
:fa-check: Draft of your pod's [Interactive Learning Resource](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/interactive-learning-resource/).  

#### Things to do...

:fa-wordpress: Choose one of your 4 posts that you would like me to assess for **15% of your grade**. Feel free to polish it up in alignment with feedback you get from your learning pod. To ensure that I can find this post, please add the category `showcase` to this one post.  
:fa-wordpress: Add the category `peer-review` to your peer review post so that I can easily find it for assessment. **(15% of your final grade)**  
:fa-wordpress: Work with your learning pod to polish and revise your [Interactive Learning Resource](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/interactive-learning-resource/). You should submit a completed learning resource on a stand-alone website that each of your pod members have access to. You are encouraged to consult with me if you have questions. **Each pod member** should publish a post on their own site with a link to the learning resource *and* add a menu item with a link to the resource. **(50% of your final grade)**    
:fa-wordpress: To ensure that I can find your final posts and assignments, please create a menu item with the following sub-items:
- top item should be a blank custom link (enter a `#` in the URL field) with the label `Assessments`.
  - sub-item 1 should be your blueprint (if it is on the web)
  - sub-item 2 should be your showcase post
  - sub-item 3 should be your peer review post
  - sub-item 4 should be a link to your pod's interactive learning resource
