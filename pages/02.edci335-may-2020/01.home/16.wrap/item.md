!!!! Apologies to those of you who have read a very similar post in another course.

As we finish EDCI335, it is worth thinking about where we started and where we are now.

We began the course way back in May (it seems like forever has passed in this weird, time-warped world) with a set of goals listed on the syllabus:

- Identify prominent learning theories (behaviourism, constructivism, connectivism, etc.)
- Compare various learning design approaches (inquiry, project-based, etc.)
- Understand the components of learning design (Learning Objectives, activities, assessment, resources)
- Identify components of assessment, including reliability, validity, assessment types, and taxonomies
- Identify strategies to accommodate diverse learners and apply them to learning designs
- Construct and identify well aligned learning design strategies
- Identify various theoretical/design models appropriate for the learning context
- Identify and evaluate various digital, networked, and open technologies and understand how they impact the learners and the learning process
- Develop an interactive learning resource supported by current research

Over the last 13 weeks, we have systematically covered each one of these outcomes (you can check the topics we covered), and you have worked together in learning pods to provide cooperative and individual ways for each of you to demonstrate your learning.

I got you started organizing yourselves into learning pods knowing that in an online course, during a pandemic, there is no good way for you to interact with each other if it is a whole group conversation. There is no way to follow the posts of up to 44 other learners and also do the work of making sense of it all for your context. Furthermore, and to pull back the curtain a bit, there is no good way for me to provide meaningful feedback to each one of you. It usually takes 10-12 or so hours of my time to fairly assess 30 blog posts and to provide feedback, and that is in addition to teaching 2 other courses and my day-job work.

I write that not to complain, because I do enjoy teaching this course very much, but to show that it would be impossible for me to keep up with the workload if I were assessing everything on my own.

This is why the learning pods are so important in this course. The learning pods are where you are able to discuss issues among yourselves and bring me in as needed, which many of you did. We were also able to use the learning pods to provide feedback and discuss your grade on the blueprint. This was a very intentional choice that allowed me to learn about your work in a richer context. Many of you were able to clarify things for me that I was initially confused about, and your grades improved as a result.

I hope this has modelled for you a course structure that, as a student in another course mentioned in her post

> [amplif[ies] the perspective and voice of students](https://studentblog241.opened.ca/topic-4-the-final-blog-post/)

If you are going to have a voice, then I need to step back and get out of your way. What I have seen so far in your posts and in your interactive learning resources is a group of learners who are engaged and interested in the topics and who have excellent ideas about learning design. I really am proud of the work **YOU** have done, and I think you should be too.

It may have felt a bit isolated in this asynchronous environment, but the course is structured specifically to reduce that through the learning pods and opening up the course to the web, where there is a vibrant and rich community of people at all stages of their journey with learning design. I trust that your learning pods were a microcosm of that community.

For some of you, my feedback on your work has led to you revising and resubmitting, and this has meant that you have been able to engage in the *process* of learning, and that is very good. Others of you didn't need this opportunity, and that is entirely expected. I'm grateful for all of your work.

#### Wrapping up

As you finish the requirements of this course (and maybe other courses too), here are some final tips based on questions that have come in in the last few days.

:fa-check: you need to have completed all four individual posts and published them on your own blog under the category `edci335`.  
:fa-check: choose ***ONE*** of those posts for me to assess as part of your portfolio. You ***MAY*** choose to revise and expand your post, but you are not required to do this. Expanding on your post might include finding another scholarly, peer-reviewed article or two on the topic from the library, or maybe engaging with the community on Twitter about the topic, and then revising your post to include a broader perspective. Please don't exceed 500-700 words. If you have already published your final post, you can continue editing it...I will never know.  
:fa-check: make sure there is a link to your pod's interactive learning resource in the menu of your own site, and that there are links to your individual sites on your interactive learning resource site.  
:fa-question: The rubric that I use for grading is published in the course syllabus, on the last page. [For a more visual representation, please see this page.](https://teaching.madland.ca/solo)

The official course end date is Friday, July 31, and grade are due August 4, so please make every effort to ensure your work is complete by July 31 (end of day Pacific time), but let me know if you will be prevented from doing so.
