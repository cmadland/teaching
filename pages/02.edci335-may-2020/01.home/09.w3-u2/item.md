!!!! In a class this size, it is very difficult for me to provide individualized feedback on your posts. Your learning pods are your primary source of interaction. However, if you have a specific question, please let me know. One of the best parts of teaching is meeting with learners one-on-one or in small groups where the conversation can be more natural. That said, I do like to highlight some of your posts, as below...

In reading through your posts from the last couple of weeks, I'm encouraged by your thoughtfulness in writing. Thank you for your work in connecting the subject matter of this course with your past experiences. I think we have all, [like Millie, experienced the rush of dopamine that comes with being rewarded with a sticker for our work](https://edci335-mni.opened.ca/76-2/). Even better if it was a scratch and sniff sticker that smelled like pizza! Behaviourism is a very powerful idea, and I know that even university learners have been known to be highly motivated by smelly stickers. In fact, there is a large project in education to explore the use of digital badges (stickers you can put on your website, but we haven't figured out how to make them smelly) for motivating learners.

Hopefully, more of us have experienced the benefits of working on 'real-life' projects with actual clients, [like Cyrus describes in his post](https://edci335-carora.opened.ca/blog-prompt-1/). Motivation to learn can come from different sources, but using 'real-life' or what many educators call 'authentic' tasks, is one way to move from extrinsic motivators (like smelly stickers), to intrinsic motivators (like wanting to make a real contribution). Also, Trinh's post is a really good example of a learner being intentional about their approach to learning. Next week, we'll talk about the difference between deep and surface approaches to learning, and Trinh's post provides a first-hand account of how she changed from a surface approach to a deep approach to learning.

One final post I'll mention for today is [CC's post where they describe one of their favourite learning experiences](https://thisiscc.opened.ca/week-1-learning-experience-and-theories/). CC's story is a good one as it can remind us all that learning is complex and it isn't always the case that a single learning theory can provide the basis for all learning contexts. While digital learning environments tend to lean towards constructivism, that doesn't mean constructivism is the only way.

!!!! Thanks again for all your work! Watch for a new post tomorrow morning (probably by 9am Pacific time).
