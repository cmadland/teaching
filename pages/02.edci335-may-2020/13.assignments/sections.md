### Due Dates

This course is on a very tight timeline and we need to complete a full 1.5 units in half the time it normally takes to do so. In addition, we don't have any required class meetings; you are responsible for scheduling your time and work in order to complete the course. As your instructor, there are obligations that I have to UVic with respect to submitting my assessment of your work so that the Department of Curriculum and Instruction and Senate for approval. What this all means is that there is a limited amount of time for you to complete the requirements of this course in order to be granted credit towards your degree.

Within the course schedule, there is limited flexibility regarding when you submit assignments as the assignments are designed to build upon one another, and in the case of the Interactive Learning Resource, the rest of the class is dependent on your work being completed on time so that they can do their work.

You must submit your Learning Design Blueprint **prior** to submitting your Interactive Learning Resource which must be submitted as a draft by the end of week 4 if you want to receive peer review feedback.

If you and/or your group are going to have difficulty submitting assignments by the due date, you **MUST** talk to me ahead of time. Do not wait until the last minute to do so.

### Participation Requirements

Successful completion of this course will be dependent upon your participation in the conversations that happen online, particularly through your blog. You should check the blog at least daily. I will typically post an overview of each week on Monday morning as well as follow-up posts throughout the week. It is recommended that you subscribe to the feed of posts from the course blog so that you will be notified of every new post.

As this is an online course with no scheduled meeting times, there are no 'attendance' requirements.
