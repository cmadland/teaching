You may be familiar with the challenge that it is to change someone else's mind. If you have ever argued with someone whose beliefs are different from yours, whether they are a friend or a random stranger on the internet, you likely know that even the strongest arguments against their view, that are utterly convincing for you, seem to make them believe even more strongly that they are correct.

This is because our ideas, regardless of what they are or how truthful they may be, become thoroughly embedded in very strong connections in our brains, and they are *extremely* persistent. In reality, everybody has misconceptions about the world.

Here is a little quiz for you. Don't worry, it's not part of your grade.

How did you do? Did you get it on the first try? If you didn't, you may have given yourself an example of a misconception that you hold about the world.

Here's a short video from Derek Muller of the YouTube channel [Veritasium](https://veritasium.com).

:fa-question: Did you notice Skinner's influence?

These misconceptions about the world, combined with what is known as *confirmation bias*, meaning that we give more credibility to ideas we already agree with, and less credibility to ideas we disagree with, lead to a situation where it is *very* difficult to change someone's mind.

When you think about it though, *learning is changing your mind* about something. That is why learning is difficult. It takes focussed work and effort, like we discussed last week.

Here is another video, this one from Destin Sandlin at [Smarter Every Day](https://smartereveryday.com). As you watch, consider the role of *neuroplasticity* in teaching and learning.

The difficulty of learning a skill like riding a backwards bike is a good example of how our patterns of thinking can become rigid and inflexible. If you recall the reading from last week about constructivism, you will realize that the cognitive process of integrating new knowledge into older knowledge structures can be a difficult one. One exposure to an idea (like in a lecture, or reading) is rarely enough for a person to develop a deep and accurate *understanding* of the idea.

This is why the strategies from week one are so important. It takes time to learn well.

# :fa-book: Reading

The readings this week are critical to your success and understanding in this course as they provide the foundation fro your work toward planning, designing, and implementing your *Interactive Learning Resource* (worth 40% of your grade in the course).

!!!! Please read chapters 3-4 of [Teaching in a Digital Age](https://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage), paying attention to the following key ideas:

You are encouraged, but not required, to annotate the chapters using [hypothes.is](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/hypothes-is).

:fa-check: the strengths and weaknesses of `lecturing, talking, doing, and feeling` as teaching methods <br>
:fa-check: the `ADDIE model` of instructional design <br>
:fa-check: the problems with trying to use `classroom` models of teaching in `online` environments <br>
:fa-check: the characteristics of and differences between `online collaborative learning, competency-based learning, and communities of practice` <br>
