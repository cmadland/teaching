Welcome to the final week of EDCI335!

There is no new content this week (from me at least), but that does not mean that your cognitive effort is done!

By this morning (Monday, June 24), you should have received feedback on your draft learning resources from 2-4 peers. Your task this week is to revise your learning resources *as appropriate* based on the feedback that you received.

!!!! You are NOT required to incorporate every recommendation from your peers!

I do suspect that your peers will point out some things that will help you refine your submission, but some feedback may lack context and may not actually fit with your content or how you have structured your resource.

In your final draft, you will need to add a couple of things to your learning resource:

- links to each peer review of your resource
- a rationale for your choices in your revisions. In other words, let me know why you did or did not incorporate feedback from your peers. Your rationale needs to be connected in some way to the topics and readings in the course.

I have set CourseSpaces to allow another submission for the Interactive Learning Resource. Do not try to delete your previous attempt.

Once you have submitted the link to your learning resources, you will need to submit to me, in confidence through CourseSpaces, an assessment of your group process. This submission is worth 5% of your final grade.

And finally...you should have received a link to the Course Experience Survey, which is a tool that UVic uses to improve this course for future learners. I'd be grateful for your feedback.

!!!! The Course Experience Survey results are not available to me until after I have submitted your final grades, and even then, they are anonymized. The survey will close on Thursday, June 27.
