# Calendar Description

An introduction to the practice of learning design and its application to interactive learning environments. Students will explore the principles of learning design; examine how they can maximize the effectiveness, efficiency and appeal of learning experiences for learners; and teach for understanding. Students will have the opportunity to plan, design, and develop an interactive learning environment using the latest technology tools specifically for teaching and learning.

# Course Description/Goals

Upon successful completion of this course, learners should be able to

- plan and design interactive learning experiences using technology tools;
- reflect on and assess progress towards learning goals in relation to their own work and the work of others;
- exercise personal freedom and responsibility in digitally networked learning environments;
- describe the role of technology in equitable learning environments;
- critique traditional, teacher-centred learning environments in light of learning models that prioritize learner agency;

It is possible that you will not be moving towards a career as a teacher in a public school, as is common for people taking courses in education, but rather as a marketer, economist, psychologist, brain surgeon, rocket scientist, or parent. Regardless of your personal career and life goals, there will be times where you will be called upon to think carefully about how people learn things and how technology shapes modern learning environments. This course is intended to give you the opportunity to begin to develop some knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be able to create, and sometimes advocate for, digital learning environments that are not only effective for learning, but are also equitable and just.

# Territory Acknowledgement

I acknowledge with respect the Lkwungen-speaking peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

I also acknowledge with regret that education has been used as a weapon against the lives and cultures of the Indigenous Peoples in Canada and commit myself to promoting Indigenous self-determination and reconciliation between Indigenous and settler communities.

# Diversity and Equity Statement

Our Faculty of Education embraces an inclusive learning community that respects and recognizes that we are enriched and strengthened by diversity including, but not limited to, ethnicity and national origins, language, gender and gender identity, sexuality, ability, age, socioeconomic status, and spirituality. We are committed to increasing the participation of people who have been historically and systemically excluded from higher education and welcome all who share this aspiration. We are committed to answering the Calls to Action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. We are a campus that educates for and encourages respect, acceptance of others, inclusion and diversity, with one principal limit: acts that incite hatred, espouse or encourage bigotry, either implied or explicit, will not be tolerated.
