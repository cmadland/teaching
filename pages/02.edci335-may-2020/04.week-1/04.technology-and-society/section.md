### :fa-question-circle: How does technology influence teaching?

We are going to dig a little deeper into what teaching (the flip-side of learning) is and how it happens in this topic. You'll read a chapter from an online book, and begin to think about how technology can impact teaching and learning, for better or for worse.

The chapter is linked below, please take a few minutes to read and [annotate](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/hypothesis) as you go. You don't need to read this deeply, but you should have an idea about what `epistemology` is, as well as `objectivism`, `behaviourism`, `cognitivism`, `constructivism`, and `connectivism`.

Did you watch the embedded video of BF Skinner? If not, here it is, it's short, but important. While you watch, try to complete the activity below the video.

### What's going on here?

Educational technology is not new. BF Skinner was singing the praises of his *teaching machine* in the mid 1950s, and his ideas were not new either. Thomas Edison was doing the same in the early 1900s.

<a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/702493" title="Thomas A. Edison quote"><img src="//www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-i-believe-that-the-motion-picture-is-destined-to-revolutionize-our-educational-system-thomas-a-edison-70-24-93.jpg" alt="I believe that the motion picture is destined to revolutionize our educational system and that in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely, the use of textbooks. - Thomas A. Edison"></a>

What is interesting about both of these examples is that they were both completely wrong. We don't see Skinner's teaching machines in classrooms, and motion pictures have certainly not *revolutionized* education or *supplanted textbooks entirely* or even partially. Right?

Or maybe we do. Did you realize that the 'fill-in-the-blanks' activity that you completed (maybe, thanks for indulging me) was exactly the same as Skinner's teaching machine? Sure, it looks nicer, has an easier interface, and is much more portable. But it is the exact same activity. Students fill in a missing word or phrase, then do something to get feedback from the machine.

Unfortunately, that leads us to the question of how technology is influencing education today. I would argue that the only difference between Skinner's machine and many modern educational technologies is the scale at which modern technologies can be deployed. If we thought that maybe Skinner's machine wasn't doing a good job of actually educating learners, why would we think that putting it into a slick web interface will make it any more effective?
