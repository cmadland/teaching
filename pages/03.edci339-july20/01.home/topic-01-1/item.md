Good morning everyone!

Just a quick update for you with a couple reminders.

!! Tomorrow, Wednesday July 8, is the last day to drop EDCI 339 and get a full refund on your tuition. I don't want you to leave, but if you need to, your time is limited!

:fa-check: [The FIPPA quiz is available in CourseSpaces](https://coursespaces.uvic.ca) and will be available until Friday, July 10, 10:00am PDT.  
:fa-check: [Make sure you read yesterday's post](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339/colins-posts/) and follow the checklist provided.  
:fa-book: There is a bunch of reading to do along with the quiz and your first post. Please make sure you complete these activities by Thursday, July 9 (although the quiz will be available until Friday morning...)

Thank you to those who have filled out the Learning Pathways Survey and introduced yourself in the forum! It really is important to work quickly and consistently throughout this course as the pace is very fast. Please let me know if you are having any challenges!
