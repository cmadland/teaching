As you know by now, the remainder of EDCI 339 will be run from WordPress. Please bookmark [https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339) for easy reference.

The link you will see in WordPress is a link to a single post on my personal blog, which will open in a new tab or window (depending on your browser settings). To return to the course site, switch to the original tab or window, or close this tab.

Updates will show up on the [course site](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339), with the newest update always at the top of the list.

You can find the content and activities for each unit by tapping 'Units' in the menu bar, then the unit that you are currently working on. Please work through the pages in each unit in numerical order.

**Your** work in the rest of the course will happen **on your own blog** that you will set up in Unit 3. It is very important that you get to work on this as soon as possible so that we can work through any difficulties you may encounter.

To get started on Unit 3, please [return to the course site](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339), tap 'Units' in the menu, then 'Unit 3'.
