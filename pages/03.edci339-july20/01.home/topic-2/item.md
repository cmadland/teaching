[plugin:content-inject](_important-reminders)

As you know by now, the remainder of EDCI 339 will be run from WordPress. Please bookmark [https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci339) for easy reference. Keep in mind that there are two sections of EDCI 339 that are using this site for their course (A03 with me and A04 with Verena Roberts), and the readings are different for each section.

You can find links to my updates under 'Sections' then 'Section A03 with Colin'. The links to updates will open in a new tab or window (depending on your browser settings). To return to the course site, switch to the original tab or window, or close this tab.

**Your** work in the rest of the course will happen **on your own blog** that you should have set up by now. It is very important that you get to work on this as soon as possible so that we can work through any difficulties you may encounter.
