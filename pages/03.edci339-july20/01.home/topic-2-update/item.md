Good morning everyone! Or maybe good afternoon...as some of you mentioned in your introductory posts, an advantage of distributed learning environments like this one is that you can participate on your own time, even though we have a schedule to keep!

In order to keep things on track, it is worth checking in on what you should have completed so far. [Please check the schedule page](https://teaching.madland.ca/edci339-july20/schedule) and make sure that you have completed all of the activities so far. The most important activities so far are Individual Posts 1 and 2.

*Also, if you are not yet plugged into a learning pod, you need to either connect with one today, or get in touch with me as soon as possible. Your first major assignment is due **Friday, July 17**, and it is to be completed with your learning pod.*

I have had a question come up about the optional activities mentioned on the syllabus. Those are intended to encourage you to engage with the course materials on the open web. I have dropped the ball in structuring that activity for you, and have decided that you will **NOT** be required to provide evidence of your engagement with the optional activities. I apologize for the confusion.

### Thoughts on 'Distributed' vs. 'Open'

One of the things that you will be sorting out through your pod project is the difference between `distributed` and `open` learning environments.

| Distributed | Both | Open |
|---|---|---|
|   | analog (offline) or digital (online)  |   |
|   | in-person attendance not required (location)  |   |
|   | synchronous attendance not required (time)  |   |
| access is limited   |   | access is not limited   |
| learner work is hidden   |   | learner work is considered a contribution to public knowledge and is accessible   |
| more often accredited   |   | can be non-accredited   |

Here is a conversation between Robin DeRosa and Clarissa Sorenson-Unruh that goes deeper into the unique characteristics of what 'open' is.

I'm looking forward to seeing Individual Post #2 on your blogs!
