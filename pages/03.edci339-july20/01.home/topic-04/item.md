[plugin:content-inject](_important-reminders)

I aim to have your pod projects assessed this week. I will aim for Friday afternoon or evening.

!! Remember that I have dropped the requirement to complete the Optional Activities for the portfolio. I will follow up with more details tomorrow.

Topic 4 is our opportunity to both practice and reflect on openness in education. We have considered that this course is both distributed (you don't need to be in a particular room at a particular time on campus in order to participate) and open (the course materials are available on the open web and anyone is welcome to participate, even without paying tuition). For the next several days, you are invited to at least observe, but hopefully participate in the ongoing conversation and community of open educators and learners on Twitter.

!! Keep in mind, Twitter will store your info on US servers, and they are going to give you ads.  

!! You do **not** need to sign up for a Twitter account to participate in this activity.


### Twitter

The little elephant-bird in the room!

For those who don't know, Twitter is a 'micro-blogging' service where each post is limited to 280 characters (not words, characters). One of the best things about Twitter is that you can curate who you follow so that your feed shows you stuff that `you` are interested in. You can also `mute` words so Tweets with that word won't show up in your timeline. And you can `block` people from following you or seeing your Tweets.

Another good thing about Twitter is that you can follow along with certain topics or conversations without signing up for an account.

For example, if you want to see what I've been tweeting, just go to :fa-link:[https://twitter.com/colinmadland](https://twitter.com/colinmadland) and have a look. If you want to follow the hashtag #edtechuvic, you can do that too at :fa-link:[this link](https://twitter.com/explore), then enter #edtechuvic into the 'Search Twitter'' bar at the top.

Give it a try, go to :fa-link:[Twitter](https;//twitter.com) and search for some of the following accounts:

##### UVic
- @colinmadland
- @verenanz
- @_valeriei
- @mpaskevi

##### Authors of EDCI 339 Readings

##### EDCI 339 Learners who have given permission to share

- @ToddBergeron10
- @t_greenlay
- @Crystal96874284
- @LucasLe74381899
- @_alex1112

Or some of these hastags:

- \#edci339
- \#edtechuvic
- \#tiegrad
- \#bcedchat
- \#openped
- \#opened
- \#OER
- \#FemEdTech

As you browse these resources, pay attention to the things that are less visible.

:fa-question: Whose voices are amplified?   
:fa-question: Whose voices are suppressed?  
:fa-question: What is being shared (articles, links, conversations...)?     
:fa-question: How does an 'open' platform like Twitter help learners and educators? [Twitter is open in that it is free to access on the web. It is most emphatically not open in how it does business.]  
:fa-question: How can Twitter harm learners and educators?  

#### TwitterChat

Thursday evening between 7:00 and 8:00 pm (PDT), we will be having a Twitterchat. Verena (the instructor in section A04) and I will host and we will post questions on #edci339. This will be an open conversation, so there will likely be people from well beyond the class who chime in and participate, and you are invited to join as well! This will be a great opportunity for you to connect with others in the class, in the other section, and around the world.

If you can't make it at that particular time, you are welcome to search the hashtag on Twitter afterwards and you can still contribute. Often the conversations in TwitterChats extend well beyond the times specified as others find the hashtag.
