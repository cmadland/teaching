This is the final official topic in this course, and it is an important one. In higher ed, there is an expectation that student work will be of sufficient academic quality,  often called 'rigour'. This is why the University of Victoria publishes the grading standards in every syllabus, and why I also published information about the SOLO Taxonomy.

The key idea, as we talked about in Week 2, is that there needs to be alignment between the learning outcomes for the course and the activities in which learners engage to demonstrate their attainment of the learning outcomes. So if one of your learning outcomes relates to critical thinking, then the assessment of that learning outcome must require the learner to demonstrate the ability to think critically.

There are a few things I'd like for you to take away from this week.

- a refresher on constructive alignment,
- the difference between `formative` and `summative` assessment
- some practical assessment strategies that you can implement in your learning resources.

Your primary work this week is to finish your draft interactive learning resource and make sure that you have the following:

1. clearly defined outcomes that answer the question `What will learners be able to do after completing the learning resource?`
  - avoid the use of the word 'understand' in your outcomes
2. learning activities that clearly enhance `interaction`,
3. assessments that are clearly aligned to the learning outcomes

There are some resources below related to assessment in online learning contexts. You do not need to read them all in detail, but you might want to skim through them fro some ideas.

!!!! There is no blog post due this week! I'd like you to be able to focus on putting your best effort into this first draft of your Interactive Learning Resource.

I encourage you to make a concerted effort to have your draft submitted by Sunday evening so that you can get some feedback from your colleagues in week 6. Then at the end of week 7, you will submit your final drafts of your resources.

Please be in touch if you have any questions at all!
