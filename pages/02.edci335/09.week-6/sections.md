Ok, it's the final stretch, and there are several assessments due over the next couple of weeks.

## :fa-pencil:Peer Reviews

This week (June 17-23) is an opportunity for you to explore the resources that your peers created and provide some substantive feedback. The feedback that you provide will be used by the other group as they refine their Interactive Learning Resources next week, and it will be submitted to me as 10% of `your` final grade.

Your review will `NOT` be considered as part of your peers' grades.

### Logistics

To determine whose resource you will review, please sign into CourseSpaces and click the link to the `Cooperative Group Sign-up`.

!! If your name is not on the sign-up sheet or if you changed groups since the sign-up, make sure you add it to the bottom of the list so that your resource can be reviewed. Please make sure this has been completed by the end of the day on Monday so that you don't miss out.

- Please add a link to your resource in the column to the right of your group names.
- Each `individual` will review the resource created by the `group` immediately below them on the list.
  - There are a couple of you working on your own. Please consider yourselves a part of group 5 with Cooper, so that Group 6 receives more than one review.
  - In the end, each group will receive 3-4 reviews.
- The group at the bottom of the list on Tuesday morning will review Group 1's resource. This will ensure that people who may not be on the list yet have an opportunity to add their names.

!!!! Please let me know as soon as possible if you have questions!

### Notes on Collegiality

Your task in this process is to help your colleagues improve their learning resources. Please ensure that you focus your feedback on the `structure` of their resource as related to each of the topics that we covered in class. Your task is not to criticize the `content` that your colleagues have chosen as their topic. This means that you don't need to be an expert in the content area of the resource in order to help your colleagues improve their resource.

A good way to ensure that you are being collegial is to ask questions in your review, like the following:
- Do you have an assessment linked to this outcome?
- Do you need to cite this idea?
- In what way is this activity interactive?

You can also use language that indicates that your criticism is tentative and may be a misunderstanding:
- It seems to me that...
- I might have missed something...
- Correct me if I'm wrong...
- Perhaps you might consider...

If English is your first language, don't feel that you need to correct every little detail of English grammar. Some of your colleagues are writing in their second or third language, or, as someone wrote earlier, they are learning their third language using their second language. This is not a course in English grammar and writing. If there is a section that really doesn't make sense, you can suggest that they seek assistance with making it more clear, but if the idea is communicated, even if a little awkwardly, then that is fine.

Reviews that criticize the people that created the resource will not be considered for grades.

Here are the details of the assignment, embedded from the `Assignments` page.

## :fa-wordpress:Blog Post 5

Also due on Sunday is your final blog post of the course. This post should be a summary of your experience during your learning challenge including things that worked well, and what didn't work well. As always, make sure you draw connections between your experience and the readings throughout the course. I encourage you to refer back to previous posts through hyperlinks or other methods of embedding content.

Please also include at least one link to one of your colleagues posts and include a comment on how their post was helpful or otherwise meaningful to you.

As always, images and videos are appreciated!
