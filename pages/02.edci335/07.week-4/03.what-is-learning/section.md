So, if there are so many problems with edtech, why would I be a career edtech practitioner? Good question.

The truth is, as I mentioned before, edtech is not neutral, but it is not necessarily bad either. This class is an example of one way that technology can enable remote learners to engage in a course from where they are rather than being required to move to a central campus. Sometimes family emergencies require international travel and disruptions that, in the past, would have put learners at a huge disadvantage, but with course materials and interactions available anywhere with a network connection, access can be preserved.

More importantly than that, though, is that there is a huge community of technologists working to provide tools that enable learners to learn to control their own narrative on the web; to reclaim their own domain on the web. This is why yo have been empowered to create your own sites for this course. You *own* your domain. You control your content and who can see it. You are making real decisions about who can access your learning process.

I hope that this course will be a big step towards digital self-determination for you. I hope you will become less reliant on giant tech monopolies like Google, Microsoft, Baidu, Amazon, and the like.

One of the most significant ways I can think to encourage digital self-determination is to teach you how to use `FLOSS`. No, I don't mean for your teeth and gums, I mean `F`ree/`L`ibre `O`pen-`S`ource `S`oftware
