### Cooperative Group Assessment (Individual) - 5%

As a component of your Interactive Learning Resource submission, **each individual** in your group must submit to me a **confidential** reflection on the group process and effectiveness. This reflection will constitute 5 of your grade for the assignment and will be submitted via dropbox in CourseSpaces.

This reflection should be 250-300 words and include discussion of what worked well, what didn't work and how you would change it, and a grade /5 for yourself and each of your group members in a table format.

I will use the peer and self-assessment grades to determine your grade for this portion of the course.
