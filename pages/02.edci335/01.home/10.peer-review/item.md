Good morning everyone! Just a short update this morning.

I've posted details of your tasks for this week under `Units` in the menu. Please read the page carefully and let me know as soon as possible if you have any questions about the peer review process.

There is no new content this week as your efforts are geared towards helping your colleagues refine their Interactive Learning Resources.

I've also added some resources and thoughts around assessment under `Units > Week 5`. You may want to consider these ideas as you review your colleagues resources and as you refine your own resources next week.

Hope you all have a great week! Please let me know if you'd like to set up a time to meet.
