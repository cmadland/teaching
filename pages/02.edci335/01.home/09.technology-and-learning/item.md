Week 4 materials are posted!

I'm at a conference at UBC today, and today is my 24th wedding anniversary (I don't feel that old!), so this is a bit shorter post.

We are looking at some different web technologies and media this week.

I'll be having a read through your 2nd and 3rd posts starting tomorrow.

Cheers for now,
Colin
