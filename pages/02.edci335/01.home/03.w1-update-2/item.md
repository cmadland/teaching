Short update this morning...

===

I've read all of the posts that have been published so far and left brief comments on all of those I had access to. It seems that OAC blogs are still offline as of 6:45 am this morning. Hopefully someone from University Systems will be arriving at work soon and will be able to get things back online.

For those who are blogging on WordPress.com, you likely received an email notification that you have a comment that needs moderation. If you aren't familiar with that process, you will need to sign in to your blog and either approve or delete comments. You can also mark comments as spam (hopefully not mine, but that's ok too...). WordPress sites are known to gather spammers trying to sell all sorts of things and it is a good idea to keep marking those comments as such.

If you haven't yet published a self-introduction post, please do and make sure you add your blog url to the forum in CourseSpaces!
