Just a quick update this morning (Tuesday, May 28).

I've received Blueprints from everyone and had a quick read through them. I'm really quite excited about the topics you have all chosen from programming in Java, to demystifying Computer Science, FinTech (Financial Technology, like cryptocurrency...I think), Chines tea, Sichuan cooking, Electronic Health Records and others that I am likely missing right now as I hurry out the door! It's great to see you passionate about the stuff you are studying, especially as many of you are taking this course as one of the final credits in your degree.

I will provide some more detailed and personalized feedback in the next few days, but I thought I would let you know that you can all safely start working on developing your Interactive Learning Resources. I'm really pleased overall with where you are all going.

Please let me know if you have questions or difficulties!
