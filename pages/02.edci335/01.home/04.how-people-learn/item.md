Hi everyone! I hope you are having a great long weekend!

This rainy morning is ideal for dealing with the FOMO of not being able to get outside too much today.

This week, we are going to dig a little more deeply into how people actually learn. You will watch a short, and hopefully entertaining, video about riding bicycles, read a couple chapters in Bates, engage in your first week of learning in your personal challenge, and, importantly, complete your [Learning Design Blueprint](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/cooperative-learning), which is due Sunday, May 26 and is worth 15% of your final grade.

The blueprint is a critical component of the course and also your work in the Interactive Learning Resource assignment, so that is why your blueprint `must` be submitted before you submit your Interactive Learning resource.

If you would like, we can schedule a time to meet in BlueJeans so you can ask your questions and get responses all at once rather than a bajillion emails.

I've added a Doodle poll to CourseSpaces that will allow us to schedule a time. I'll pick the most popular time.

I'll be reading your first graded posts over the next couple days. Thank you all for your work!
