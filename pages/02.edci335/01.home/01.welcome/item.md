# Welcome!

Hello everyone, and welcome to EDCI 335, *Learning Design*.

I'm looking forward to spending the next seven weeks with you talking about how to design learning experiences for learners using digital technologies. We'll explore questions about how learning actually works, how technology is influencing society and learning, and how you can evaluate the quality of learning resources that you encounter.

# What's up this week?

This is a busy week, so it is in your best interest to get started early. You will need to:

:fa-check: Get oriented to how the course works.<br>
:fa-check: Sign up for a WordPress blog.<br>
:fa-check: Email me your blog URL.<br>
:fa-check: Customize your blog.<br>
:fa-check: Post a self-introduction.<br>
:fa-check: Read two relatively short chapters.<br>
:fa-check: Form your cooperative groups.<br>
:fa-check: Publish your first 'official' post.<br>


## Getting started

To begin, you need to carefully read the syllabus for this course, [which can be found on the CourseSpaces site (UVic's Moodle installation; login required)](https://coursespaces.uvic.ca) The syllabus is the official document that outlines what you will learn (outcomes), how you will demonstrate your learning, and how your grade will be determined (assessments). It also includes links to important University policies such as Academic Integrity, the use of editors, sexualized violence, and resources for learners with learning challenges.

! You are responsible for reading and understanding the syllabus. If you have a question about the course, please check the syllabus first, and if you can't find your answer there, feel free to reach out to me.

Make sure you spend a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout of this site so that you know where to find the information that you will need.

### How to follow this course.

You should realize by now that this course is not only happening in CourseSpaces, but there is also a significant portion of the course that is on a different site at [edtechuvic.ca/edci335](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335). This means that the *content* of the site is open on the web. Anyone with a web browser can access this page. You are also *invited* to post your work on an open website using WordPress, but you are not *required* to do so. Please read through the [WordPress Resources page](http://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/wordpress/).

There are some people who simply cannot have a web presence. If this is you, I am happy to provide options for you to protect your privacy as outlined on the WordPress resources page.

#### Course Blog - https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335 (this site)

Course updates, information about weekly readings, learning activities and assessments are posted here on the course blog. Please bookmark this site and ***check at least daily***. It is strongly recommended that you subscribe to updates so that you receive an email every time I publish an update post. You can find a widget in the footer of this site where you can enter your email address to subscribe.

I will post weekly updates and commentary here on the course blog every Monday morning by 7:00 am. You will also be able to see course announcements on the right side of the course blog homepage.

The sidebar of the home page of this site includes information about how to contact me and when you can expect responses. Generally, if you don't receive a response within 24 hours, you should feel free to send a follow-up email, or you can send me a [DM (Direct Message) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/colinmadland)

#### [CourseSpaces (Moodle)](https://coursespaces.uvic.ca)

You can also find some key things in CourseSpaces such as the course syllabus and some assignment dropboxes. The dropboxes will allow you to ensure that you have submitted the correct link or file for each of your assignments in the course, and it will also give me a tool to ensure that I can communicate assessment and feedback to you in a confidential manner.

I have posted my contact info in CourseSpaces.

!! You will not find any course updates in CourseSpaces. Make sure you check here!

!!!! In order to ensure that you receive notifications of updates, please scroll to the bottom of this page, enter your preferred email address, and click 'Subscribe'.

### Things to do this week!

As you know, this is a short course, so we need to dive into things relatively quickly.
