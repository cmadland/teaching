Good morning!

!!! There are still several of you who have not submitted a link to the `Blog Post 1` assignment dropbox in CourseSpaces. Please do so as soon as you are able. Feel free to let me know if you won't be able to complete this by the end of Tuesday.

The reason for asking you to submit a link is to ensure accurate tracking of your submissions and also to allow me to provide confidential feedback on your work.

So far, there are only two people who have responded to the Doodle poll in CourseSpaces about finding a time to meet in BlueJeans. Please take a few minutes to do that as well.

Hope you have a great day!
