Good morning from rainy Richmond!

I've been through each of your posts for week 1 and thoroughly enjoyed reading about how you all are planning to challenge yourself. I encourage you to jump into the 'Learner Posts' feed under 'Updates' in the menu and read about what your colleagues are going to be doing.

One of the great advantages of sharing your posts in public is that you are able to share with your family at home as well and also reach out to people who might be influencing you. For example, many of you are using YouTube as a source of information and resources. If you include links to those videos, you are doing a favour to the person who created the video by boosting their stats and giving them feedback.

### Future posts

Here are some things to keep in mind generally about using a blog for learning.

:fa-check: Make sure you link to your sources. Even if this isn't formal academic writing, it is still important to acknowledge where you get your ideas. The easiest way to do that is through an [inline link](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-on-how-to-add-a-link-in-wordpress/#linkvisualeditor). <br>
:fa-check: Remember to use the category `edci335`.<br>
:fa-check: Read each other's posts and respond to them by including links in your own posts. There are many of you who are engaging in cooking challenges. Follow each other's progress, share tips, encourage each other, challenge each other to cooking competitions! Have fun with this assignment.<br>

Post 2 is due tomorrow, but if you need to choose between post 2 and the blueprint, then delay post 2 for a couple days and focus on the blueprint.

### BluePrint

As you know, your blueprints are due tomorrow. It will be important for you to complete this assignment and submit it prior to submitting your major project, the `Interactive Learning Resource`. Several of you have contacted me with questions, and I encourage that. I'm here to help you succeed, and the sooner you get your questions answered, the better you will be able to plan your work.

Your blueprint is the planning stage for your learning resource, but don't worry about locking yourself in. Learning design is an iterative process and you will always be going back to adjust your plan as things change.

I'm available by email or text (details in CourseSpaces) all weekend if you have questions.
