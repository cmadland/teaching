### Interactive Learning Resource (Cooperative) - 35%

Your task in this assignment is to create a learning resource related to the topic of your choice (ideally a topic within your academic major). The resource should take approximately 1-2 hours for a learner to complete.

The Learning Design Blueprint assignment is the planning stage of this assignment.

!! You cannot submit this assignment without first submitting the Learning Design Blueprint and getting feedback from me.

Your task here is to use the blueprint to actually create an interactive learning resource in a digital environment. You should presume that you need to teach 15-20 people and that you have 1-2 weeks to do so. Your learners are assumed to be adult professionals who are spread across Canada and come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.

You will need to turn your Blueprint into an actual learning resource using at least one, and ideally a combination, of the technology tools that we discussed in Week 4. Your learning resource will be reviewed by your peers before you submit it to me during the final week of the course, and they will need to be able to complete the activities as if they were an actual student in your target audience.

You must include the following in your resource:

- An overview of the resource
- 2-4 learning outcomes (copied or revised from your blueprint)
- Brief commentary about each topic and activity
- ne **interactive** activity for each learning outcome/topic based on a resource aligned with that topic (blog post, video, article, etc)
- A bibliography or reference list of all resources cited and/or required for your students;
  - Use whatever citation format you are comfortable with (APA, MLA, etc) but please be consistent throughout.
- The following pages separate from your learning resource
  - A rationale for your technology choices;
  - links to each peer review of your resource
  - a rationale for why you did or did not incorporate your peers recommendations into your final resource
