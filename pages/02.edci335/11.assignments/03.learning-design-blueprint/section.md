### Learning Design Blueprint (Cooperative) - 15%

This assignment is the first component of your Interactive Learning Resource assignment and must be submitted before you submit the Interactive Learning Resource assignment. The blueprint is a cooperative activity which you will complete with the group you formed during Week 1.

[Cooperative learning is explained in greater detail in the course blog](http://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/?page_id=19&amp;preview=true), so make sure you read that before you begin.

In your groups, you need to collectively identify a concept or topic that you want to teach to a group of people. It is strongly recommended that you choose a concept related to your academic major. Once you have identified your concept, you will create a plan for your Interactive Learning Resource, which will be an activity, or series of smaller activities which should take about 1-2 hours to complete. You should divide the work amongst yourselves according to the requirements of the assignment below:

- A description of your proposed learning resource and rationale for choosing that topic;
- a concept analysis **(400-500 words)**, including the following:
  1. a concise definition citing at least 2 academic sources
  2. 1-2 examples of the concept
  3. 1-2 non-examples of the concept (mis-conceptions)
  4. 1-3 essential features of the concept (these are features which, if absent, would make the phenomenon a non-example e.g. a triangle must have three sides)
  5. 1-3 accidental features of the concept (these are features, which may or may not be present in the phenomenon e.g. a triangle must have three sides of equal length)

!!! NOTE: the concept analysis may require more than one person to ensure equitable participation.

- 2-4 learning outcomes related to your concept
\*\*SUGGESTION: identify as many learning outcomes as there are people in your group.
- a list of sub-topics that form a progression through your lesson
- a list of resources that your learners will need to access such as:
  1. textbooks (see: [open.bccampus.ca](https://open.bccampus.ca/)),
  2. scholarly articles (accessible through the UVic library)
  3. &#39;grey literature&#39; (professional resources, blogs, videos, etc)
  4. technology tools (WordPress, Etherpad, Moodle, etc)

There are multiple ways you might want to organize this information. Options include a table, a kanban board, a concept map, or another medium that you find more appropriate. The important thing is that the blueprint is easy to access and displays the information you need in a quickly readable format.
