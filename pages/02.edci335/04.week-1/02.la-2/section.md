One of the tools that you are encouraged to use throughout this course is called [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) and it allows you to annotate almost any webpage you can find. I say almost because this blog is a notable exception.

Hypothes.is is very easy to use and allows you to keep track of your notes on articles across the web. It also allows us as a class to filter out all of the annotations that may be visible on a site from other people.

[Here are instructions to sign up and use hypothes.is](http://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/hypothes-is/).

!! This is a web service that stores information on servers outside of Canada. You are NOT required to use it, and if you do use it, you are NOT required to use your real name.

!!! Remember to use the label `edci335`.
