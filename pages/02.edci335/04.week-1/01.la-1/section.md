As this course is being hosted on a public website, you need to make some decisions about how you would like to engage with me and your classmates.

:fa-check: Please [read the information about your options with WordPress](https://edtechuvic.ca/wordpress) before you sign up.<br>
:fa-check: Once you have signed up for WordPress (or contacted me if you cannot use WordPress), [start personalizing your site.](http://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/getting-started-with-wordpress/)<br>
:fa-check: Make sure you create an `edci335` category.<br>

!!!! **Important:** In order for your posts to be aggregated on the course blog, you need to send me your blog URL. Please do this in the ['Blog URLs' forum in CourseSpaces](https://coursespaces.uvic.ca/mod/forum/view.php?id=1187416).

Now that you have set up your blog, please take a few moments to publish an introductory post on your blog. Tell me and your colleagues in the course a little about yourself as you feel comfortable sharing.

Please also include a brief story about one of your favourite learning experiences.

!!! Remember to use the category `edci335`.
