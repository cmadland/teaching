### Welcome to Week 2!

This is another busy week, so please prepare accordingly. You will need to organize some times to meet with your group to complete the [*Learning Design Blueprint*](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/assignments), which is worth 15% of your final grade. There are also two chapters to read and a blog post to publish!

As always, feel free to contact me if you have questions, especially about your blueprint. Putting in some work now will make your job on the final *Interactive Learning Resource* assignment much easier.

This week, we will explore why learning can be so difficult and also what *interaction* means in learning environments.
