### Creating Groups

To wrap up this week, we need to get ready for your [major project, the Interactive Learning Resource](https://edtechuvic.madland.ca/edci335/assignments) for the course, where you will plan, design, and deploy an interactive, online learning experience. To do that well, you will be encouraged to work in cooperative groups of 2-4 people*.

[I have created and shared an online spreadsheet, linked in CourseSpaces](https://coursespaces.uvic.ca) for you to organize yourselves into groups. I recommend that you form groups around your major discipline of study at UVic, so I have included a column for you to indicate your discipline or topic area of interest. You may also want to organize your groups around similar time-zones to make it easier to meet synchronously.

It is not too early to start thinking about your topic for the assignment as you only have few weeks to plan and create your resource. You will complete the resource in two (official) stages, a planning stage where you will create the blueprint, and a development stage where you will actually create the resource.

!!!! You are strongly encouraged to seek feedback from me and from other groups in the class along the way.

!! You may not plan a resource about the same topic as another group.

### :fa-wordpress: Post #1

!!! This post is worth 7% of your final grade.

On your own blog, create a new post and write about what you plan to learn in the [*Personal Learning Challenge* assignment](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/assignments) and how this week's readings will influence how you approach your challenge.

Remember that [you will be assessed according to the SOLO Taxonomy](https://edtechuvic.madland.ca/edci335/assignments). In the context of your post, this means that you need to demonstrate that you have engaged with the readings, blog posts, videos, and other learning resources and that you have connected the ideas in those resources to your own *Personal Learning Challenge*.

! I am not looking for a simple summary of the readings. You *MUST* connect the readings to your plan.

You are not required to use any particular academic writing style like APA or MLA. A blog post is less formal than academic writing. However, if you use someone else's ideas, you need to acknowledge where those ideas came from. The standard way of doing that in a blog post is to create a link to the resource. Doing this allows people who are reading your post to follow up and learn more about what you are trying to say, and it also is a way of saying thank-you to the person who first published the idea.

You are encouraged to use the 'Featured Image' tool in WordPress, but please make sure that the image you use is licensed for reuse. You can ensure this by using search engines to search for Creative Commons images. Here are some options for you:

:fa-image: [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/)<br>
:fa-image: [Flickr Creative Commons Search](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons)<br>
:fa-image: [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)<br>
:fa-image: [Pexels.com](https://pexels.com)<br>
:fa-camera: Of course, you are welcome and encouraged to use your own images!

The images you find on Unsplash and Pexels may be very large and you might not be able to upload them without first compressing them. I recommend you use [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com) to compress images. This will help prevent your site from slowing down.

!!! When you have published your post, please copy the URL and post it into the the appropriate [assignment dropbox in CourseSpaces](https:coursespaces.uvic.ca).
