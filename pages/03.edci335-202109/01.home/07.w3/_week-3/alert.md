:fa-users: Meet with your learning pod to begin mapping out your topic and drafting your learning outcomes for your [Learning Design Blueprint](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/learning-design-blueprint/) and [Interactive Learning Resource](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/interactive-learning-resource/)  
:fa-upload: To submit your Blueprint, please send me an email with the course and assignment in the subject line, and make sure you copy each of your Pod members in the message. A link to an online document (Google Docs, Notion, or other) or an attached file are good.  
:fa-info: Monday, October 11 is Thanksgiving Day in Canada. Your Blueprint assignment is 'officially' due on Monday, but realistically, I'm not going to be looking at them until Tuesday or Wednesday, so don't panic if you need a bit more time. Please take some time to rest this long weekend in whatever way energizes you.
