Hi everyone! I hope you had a great weekend!

The schedule at the bottom of this page is a *suggested timeline*, but please aim to have everything completed by the evening of [badge label="Sunday, September 26"/]...or Monday. Remember, there aren't any 'due dates' on your blog posts, so 'late' isn't really a thing.

Thank you to those who have registered for a blog site. Keep in mind that your blog privacy settings will determine whether or not your posts can be syndicated to the course site. [See the page called 'Creating a Blog on the OpenETC'](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/creating-a-blog-on-the-openetc/) under the section 'Privacy Settings' for details.

Also, there are still several people who have not submitted the  Learning Pathways Survey. Please make sure that you have submitted the survey, found on the Social Spaces page (please contact me if you don't have the password).

Also, please get in the habit of using the category `edci335` on each of your posts. [Click here for instructions for creating categories and applying them to your posts.](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/category/) Let me know if you need assistance!

This week, we are going to dig into how people actually learn. You will watch a short, and hopefully entertaining, video about riding bicycles, [read a chapter in one of the course texts](https://edtechbooks.org/lidtfoundations/learning_and_instruction), and, importantly, get started on your [Learning Design Blueprint](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/updated-learning-design-blueprint/), which is due [badge label="Sunday, October 10" /] and is worth 20% of your final grade.

The blueprint is a critical component of the course and also your work in the Interactive Learning Resource assignment, so that is why your blueprint `must` be submitted before you submit your Interactive Learning resource.

If you would like, we can schedule a time to meet in Zoom so you can ask your questions and get responses all at once rather than a bajillion emails.
