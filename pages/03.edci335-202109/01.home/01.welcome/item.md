# Welcome!

Hello everyone, and welcome to EDCI 335, *Learning Design*.

I'm looking forward to spending the next several weeks with you talking about how to design learning experiences for learners using digital technologies. We'll explore questions about how learning actually works, how technology is influencing society and learning, and how you can evaluate the quality of learning resources that you encounter.

## Getting started

Please carefully read the syllabus for this course, which is available in BrightSpace. The syllabus is the official document that outlines what you will learn (outcomes), how you will demonstrate your learning, and how your grade will be determined (assessments). It also includes links to important University policies such as Academic Integrity, the use of editors, sexualized violence, and resources for learners with learning challenges.

! You are responsible for reading and understanding the syllabus. If you have a question about the course, please check the syllabus first, and if you can't find your answer there, check the course website and your learning pod, and if you still can't get an answer, feel free to reach out to me.

Make sure you spend a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout of this site so that you know where to find the information that you will need.

### How to follow this course.

You should realize by now that this course is not happening in BrightSpace, rather, the entire course is hosted at [edtechuvic.ca/edci335](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335). This means that the *content* of the site is open on the web. Anyone with a web browser can access this page. You are also *invited* to post your work on an open website using WordPress, but you are not *required* to do so. Please read through the [WordPress Resources page](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/wordpress/) for more information.

There are some people who simply cannot have a web presence. If this is you, I am happy to provide options for you to protect your privacy as outlined on the WordPress resources page.

#### Course Blog


Course updates, information about weekly readings, learning activities and assessments are posted on the [course blog](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/colins-posts).

It is strongly recommended that you subscribe to my post feed so that you will receive updates in Feedly, [here are instructions](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/rss-feeds). The URL to my feed is `https://teaching.madland.ca/edci335-202109/home.rss`.

I will post regular updates and commentary on the course blog every Monday morning by 9:00 am Pacific time. You will also be able to see course announcements on the right side of the course blog homepage.

The syllabus includes information about how to contact me and when you can expect responses. Generally, if you don't receive a response within 24 hours, you should feel free to send a follow-up email, or you can send me a [DM (Direct Message) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/colinmadland)
