Hello everyone, and thank you all for your work (some of which is ongoing!). Overall, I'm really pleased with how you have engaged with the course and have shown me evidence that you have learned a thing or two!

There is no 'new' content this week, so you can consider this a bit of a wrap-up week if you have things you have missed so far. [Check out the schedule](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-schedule-with-colin/) to ensure that you have completed all of the required items.

As the course ends next week, you are welcome to continue with your blogs. They are your work and yours to keep. If you intend to take another EDCI course (336, 337, 338, or 339), you may need it again. All you need to do to keep your posts separate is to create and use another category on your blog.

As I read your peer reviews, I was able to get a sneak peak at your learning resources, and I really like what I see. There is a variety of platforms that you have used, and a very wide diversity of topics that you have covered. I'm looking forward to digging into your final drafts!

Remember, as you tighten up your drafts, that `you are not required to incorporate all of your peers' recommendations`. There is some very good feedback available to you, but you know your resource better than everyone else, so the context may not necessarily fit the feedback. All I ask is that you provide a brief rationale for the feedback that you did not incorporate.

The stated due date is [badge label="Friday, December 3' /], but please let me know if your group needs a little more time to tidy things up. I hope you'll give me your best work.

The most important thing, though, is to ensure that you have completed the following things:

Looking forward to seeing your work! Feel free to [book an appointment with me](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-social-spaces/) sometime this week to talk about anything above!
