Things to do this week (and a half)...  
:fa-check: [Responses to all four blog prompts,](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/category/prompts/) including links to other blogs. These should be done by now, but it's not too late to finish!  
:fa-check: [Peer review of one other group's draft Interactive learning resource.](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/peer-review/) Please make sure you add the categories `edci335` and `peer-review` so I can find it easily. Make sure you send a link to the group who authored the resource [badge label="15% of your final grade" /]. If you have not yet sent your feedback, please do so ASAP!  
:fa-check: Add the category `showcase` to the post you have decided is your best post from the course. [This is the post I will assess for 15% of your grade.](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/community-contributions/) Aim to complete this by [badge label="]Sunday, Nov 28" /] (the syllabus says Nov 27, but I'm moving to Kelowna this weekend, and I won't be able to look on Saturday!).  
:fa-check: Update your [Interactive Learning Resource](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/interactive-learning-resource/) ***as appropriate*** based on the feedback you receive from your reviewers. You are ***not*** required to implement all of the suggestions.
