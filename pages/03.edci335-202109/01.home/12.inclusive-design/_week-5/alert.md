# October 18 - 24
Things to do this week(end)...

:fa-users: Read this week's posts in the following order - [National #AccessAbility Week](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/national-accessability-week/), [Universal Design](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/universal-design/), and then [Inclusive Learning Design](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/inclusive-learning-design/).  
:fa-twitter: Follow the hastag `#AccessAbility` on Twitter and engage in the conversation as you are comfortable.   
:fa-wordpress: Publish a blog post about one of the [prompts for this week.](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/prompt-inclusive-design/)     
:fa-users: Begin operationalizing your blueprint in your [Interactive Learning Resource](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/interactive-learning-resource/). Your ***DRAFT*** Interactive Learning Resource is due on [badge label="Tuesday, November 9" /]. Note that this is before Reading Week, which runs Nov 10-14. Hopefully you'll be able to get your draft finished and be able to find some rest over the break. If that isn't going to happen, please let me know. It is important to be a little tighter on this due date as your classmates' work depends on you being on time-ish.
