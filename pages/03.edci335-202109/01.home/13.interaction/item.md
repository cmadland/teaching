Remember summer? Seems like a long time ago that BC was in the middle of the heat dome...now we have bomb cyclones and atmospheric rivers and burning cargo ships...I hope everyone is keeping well. Seriously, though, if you are having a hard time right now, please reach out, either to me or [to any of the resources available on campus](https://www.uvic.ca/student-wellness/), or other resources available in your local area.

We are well into the back half of EDCI335 and the remainder of the course will likely go very quickly. We have 2 more units where new content will be introduced and discussed followed by Reading Week from November 10-14. After Reading Week, there won't be any more new content and you will have the remainder of the course time to work on 3 major tasks:

:fa-check: Peer review of another group's draft learning resource.  
:fa-check: Polish one of the four posts you have published into a showcase post which will be assessed for grades.  
:fa-check: Revise and complete the Interactive Learning Resource.  

So far, you should have completed the following...

You should know that I mean it when I say that I am grateful for your work in this course. Your blueprints were very well done and it was a pleasure speaking with many of you over the last week about your thoughts on the assignment and to meet many of you for the first time. As I mentioned to each of you, if you have any questions of concerns about the course, or if you are having particular challenges (whether COVID-19 related or not), please let me know. There are many ways we can work together to ensure your success in the course.

This week, we are going to think about `interaction` and how to design for it in your interactive learning resource. Obviously, interactivity should be front-and-centre in a project called '*interactive* learning resource'!

Your list of tasks for the week is at the top of this page and also on the [Schedule page on the course site](https://teaching.madland.ca/edci335-202109/schedule).

As always, please let me know if you have questions!
