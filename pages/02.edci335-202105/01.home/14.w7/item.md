[plugin:content-inject](../w7/_week-7)

There is no 'new' content this week, so you can consider this a bit of a catch-up week if you have things you have missed so far. [Check out the schedule](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-schedule-with-colin/) to ensure that you have completed all of the required items.

The most important thing, though, is to book a time for your learning pod to meet with me to discuss your blueprint. During this meeting, you will have an opportunity to walk me through your blueprint to make sure I understand what you have written. I hope these meetings will be affirming for you and your work and that we will have a friendly conversation about what you have done and how I can help you to improve. I will also work with you to make sure you know how to proceed with the Interactive Learning Resource assignment and address any questions that you may have.

Feel free to brew a cup of tea or coffee (or whatever you prefer), and find a comfortable spot, free from distractions (not a coffee shop).

Looking forward to speaking with you all!
