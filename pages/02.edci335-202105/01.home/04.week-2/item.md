[plugin:content-inject](_week-2)

The schedule above is a suggested timeline for this week, but please aim to have everything completed by the evening of ***Sunday, May 17***.

Hi everyone! I hope you had a great weekend! I spent a good chunk of my weekend planting a garden for the first time in a few years, so that was nice. I'm hoping *finally* to be able to make a batch of salsa from my tomatoes and peppers.

This week, we are going to dig into how people actually learn. You will watch a short, and hopefully entertaining, video about riding bicycles, [read a chapter in one of the course texts](https://edtechbooks.org/lidtfoundations/learning_and_instruction), and, importantly, get started on your [Learning Design Blueprint](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/learning-design-blueprint/), which is due Sunday, June 14 and is worth 20% of your final grade.

The blueprint is a critical component of the course and also your work in the Interactive Learning Resource assignment, so that is why your blueprint `must` be submitted before you submit your Interactive Learning resource.

If you would like, we can schedule a time to meet in Zoom so you can ask your questions and get responses all at once rather than a bajillion emails.
