[plugin:content-inject](_week-5)


Good morning everyone!

Thank you for your work last week! It has been good to see your posts come in! Just a reminder that I will be out of town for this week and today may be that last day I have access to the internet until Friday, June 5.

You will likely notice that we have wandered a bit from the published schedule on the syllabus, and this week is even more of a deviation to allow us to acknowledge that this is #AccessAbility Week in Canada, where we are intentional about planning for inclusion.

We hope you will be able to follow the Twitter hashtag throughout the week!
