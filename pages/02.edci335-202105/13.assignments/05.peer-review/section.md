### Interactive Learning Resource Peer Review (Individual) - 10%

By the end of Week 5 of the course, you will have substantially completed your Interactive Learning Resource as a draft and will have made it available for your colleagues in the class. During Week 6, each of you will act as beta testers for other groups' resources. You will work through the resource as a learner and make notes for the group who created the resource so that they may improve the design of their resource prior to submitting it at the end of Week 6.

Your notes and critique should focus on aspects of the resource that will be assessed (appropriate outcomes, alignment, interactivity, technology use and rationale, presentation, grammar, spelling, citations, etc) and it must be constructive. Do not simply say that 'X' is a pre-structural response; offer collegial suggestions for improvement.

Complete your review as a post on your own blog. You must include a link to the resource that you reviewed.

Your review may be a typed blog post, or you might want to record a screencast walk-through of the resource, or some other technology tool that you'd like to try. Whatever you choose to use as the medium of communication, please post your review to `your own blog` by 10:00 pm, Sunday, June 23 and send a link to each individual in the group who authored the resource you reviewed.
