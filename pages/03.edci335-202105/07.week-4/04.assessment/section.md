### :fa-wordpress: Post #4

!!! This post is worth 7% of your final grade.

On your own blog, create a new post and write about what your progress in your *Personal Learning Challenge*. Remember that [you will be assessed according to the SOLO Taxonomy](https://edtechuvic.madland.ca/edci335/assignments). In the context of your post, this means that you need to demonstrate that you have engaged with the readings, blog posts, videos, and other learning resources and that you have connected the ideas in those resources to your own learning challenge.

! I am not looking for a simple summary of the readings. You *MUST* connect the readings to your own ideas.

You are not required to use any particular academic writing style like APA or MLA. A blog post is less formal than academic writing. However, if you use someone else's ideas, you need to acknowledge where those ideas came from. The standard way of doing that in a blog post is to create a link to the resource. Doing this allows people who are reading your post to follow up and learn more about what you are trying to say, and it also is a way of saying thank-you to the person who first published the idea.

!!!! Make sure you use the category `edci335`.

### Interactive Learning Resource

You have all received feedback on your *Interactive Learning Resource* and your first draft is due at the end of this week (June 9). As you work on your draft, make sure you incorporate my feedback from your blueprint. I encourage you to help each other out with suggestions and tips on strategies and tech tools.

Make sure you cite your sources. It doesn't matter which format you use, just pick one and be consistent. Citing your sources is the way to acknowledge the source of your ideas and say thank you. If you have questions about whether or how to cite, *please let me know!* I will always help you.
