So, if there are so many problems with edtech, why would I be a career edtech practitioner? Good question.

The truth is, as I mentioned before, edtech is not neutral, but it is not necessarily bad either. This class is an example of one way that technology can enable remote learners to engage in a course from where they are rather than being required to move to a central campus. Sometimes family emergencies require international travel and disruptions that, in the past, would have put learners at a huge disadvantage, but with course materials and interactions available anywhere with a network connection, access can be preserved.

More importantly than that, though, is that there is a huge community of technologists working to provide tools that enable learners to learn to control their own narrative on the web; to reclaim their own domain on the web. This is why yo have been empowered to create your own sites for this course. You *own* your domain. You control your content and who can see it. You are making real decisions about who can access your learning process.

I hope that this course will be a big step towards digital self-determination for you. I hope you will become less reliant on giant tech monopolies like Google, Microsoft, Baidu, Amazon, and the like.

One of the most significant ways I can think to encourage digital self-determination is to teach you how to use `FLOSS`. No, I don't mean for your teeth and gums, I mean `F`ree/`L`ibre `O`pen-`S`ource `S`oftware.

WordPress is an example of FLOSS, as is hypothes.is, and, this morning (Saturday), I was saved by another example, Grav.

The advantage of FLOSS over proprietary software platforms is that it puts you as the user in control over your stuff. No longer are you required to give up your data in exchange for using software.

This week's reading, `Chapter 6-7 of Teaching in a Digital Age` will introduce you to some ideas around the characteristics and pedagogical usefulness of various educational media and technology.
