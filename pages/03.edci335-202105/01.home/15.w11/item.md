[plugin:content-inject](_week-11)

Good morning everyone!

We are through all of the new content ideas that we are going to talk about in EDCI 335 and have only a few activities to wrap up, as above.

These last three weeks are your opportunity to ensure that you have everything completed and polished for assessment.

I will be working through your peer review posts over the next week or so and am available for consultation if you have questions about your final version of your learning resource.
