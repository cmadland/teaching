Good morning everyone!

Looks like we have some days of rain ahead of us, so that is perfect for getting this course in the bag!

As you finish the DRAFT of your interactive learning resource, please send me a link, or @ me in Notion or google docs if that's appropriate AND send a link to your peer-review partner group. To find your partner group, please use this handy-dandy table that you all created for me at

![alt-text](repercussions.png "image of a sad bear confession saying Sometimes I listen to a drum solo over and over...I'm afraid there will be repercussions.")

  (ok...I definitely thought I had the URL on my clipboard...both my sons are drummers and I sent this to them last night and I'm leaving it here...enjoy!)

[Here's the actual link...](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-social-spaces/)


Please send a link to the pod BELOW yours on the table. So pod 1, please send your link to Pod 3, who will review your resource and provide feedback. Pod 11, send your link to Pod 1. There is no Pod 2.

Please post your review on your own blog and add the categories 'edci335' and 'review'. Your review can be in point form.

Please review the details of this assignment here.

If you have not received a link to a resource to review by Monday evening, June 14, please email the pod above you and copy me.

Please make sure to complete your review by Friday, June 18 so that everyone can get started on finalizing their Interactive Learning Resources.

Please let me know if you have questions!

Colin
