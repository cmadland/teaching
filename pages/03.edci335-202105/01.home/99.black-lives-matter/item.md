Like many of you, we are watching in horror as peaceful calls for equality are met with brutal attacks from police in the United States. As your instructors, we want you to know that these events affect us too and that if you are feeling overwhelmed and need to talk to someone, we are here, and we can also connect you with further support as needed.
