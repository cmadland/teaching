[plugin:content-inject](_week-2)

Hi everyone! I hope you had a great week!

The schedule above is a suggested timeline for this week, but please aim to have everything completed by the evening of [badge label="Sunday, May 16"/].

Thank you to those who have registered for a blog site. Keep in mind that your blog privacy settings will determine whether or not your posts can be syndicated to the course site. [See the page called 'Creating a Blog on the OpenETC'](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/creating-a-blog-on-the-openetc/) under the section 'Privacy Settings' for details.

Also, please get in the habit of using the category `edci335` on each of your posts. [Click here for instructions for creating categories and applying them to your posts.](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/category/) Let me know if you need assistance!

This weekend, we are going to dig into how people actually learn. You will watch a short, and hopefully entertaining, video about riding bicycles, [read a chapter in one of the course texts](https://edtechbooks.org/lidtfoundations/learning_and_instruction), and, importantly, get started on your [Learning Design Blueprint](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/learning-design-blueprint/), which is due Sunday, May 30 and is worth 20% of your final grade.

The blueprint is a critical component of the course and also your work in the Interactive Learning Resource assignment, so that is why your blueprint `must` be submitted before you submit your Interactive Learning resource.

If you would like, we can schedule a time to meet in Zoom so you can ask your questions and get responses all at once rather than a bajillion emails.

!!!! Little aside here...I got a new bike on Tuesday, [and I'm a little giddy](https://twitter.com/colinmadland/status/1392314846947856384?s=20) and [this too](https://twitter.com/colinmadland/status/1392725257941753858?s=20).
