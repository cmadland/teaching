Hello everyone!

We have a busy week this week with a little more reading than last week, one fewer days, but no blog post due.

This week, we introduce the idea of a planning framework to help guide you through the complex process of designing an effective learning resource. We also introduce an interactive tool called `hypothes.is` that we have used to annotate a chapter of the textbook with questions and comments. Please feel free, if you are comfortable doing so in public, to enter your own comments and questions and have a conversation about the chapter. Who knows, maybe the author will notice...

### Learning Pods

If you haven't done so yet, ***PLEASE*** make sure you are signed up for a learning pod! In a class this size, with no scheduled meeting times, it will be very difficult for you to interact with many people, so the learning pods will be where you go for connection with others in the course.

If you and your pod would like to meet with me to discuss anything to do with the class, please let me know and we can set up a time to do so.

See you in hypothes.is!
