I'm a little surprised that I'm just learning about Roy Amara at this point in my career, but I think that just goes to show that there is *always* more to the story.

As I was thinking through the logic and the flow of this unit and considering which external links to use, I recalled Gartner's Hype Cycle. Naturally, the promoted hit in DuckDuckGo was from Wikipedia, embedded below.

You may have heard that Wikipedia is bad, but it's not. Wikipedia is a great place to *start* your research. Often, though, the gold is in the references at the bottom of the page. Notice the quote from Amara at the top of the hype cycle page...

> We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.[3][4]

The [3] and [4] at the end of the quote are footnotes linking to the sources fo the quote. Unfortunately, these two sources are less than ideal. PCMag and a newsletter, aren't the most scholarly of sources. So I decided to search directly for `Amara's Law`. Another hit from Wikipedia...

This time, though, the citation for Amara's Law included this one...

> Susan Ratcliffe, ed. (2016). "[Roy Amara 1925â€“2007, American futurologist](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00018679)". Oxford Essential Quotations. 1 (4th ed.). Oxford University Press. [doi:10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Facref%2F9780191826719.001.0001)

That's a much better source than PCMag.
