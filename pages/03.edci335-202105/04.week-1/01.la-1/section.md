In this first week, we are going to get set up on two important web tools and then explore the ideas of what learning is and some ways that technology influences us as a society, especially in the context of education.

# :fa-wordpress: Getting Set up.

As this course is being hosted on a public website, you need to make some decisions about how you would like to engage with me and your classmates.

:fa-check: Please [read the information about your options with WordPress](https://edtechuvic.ca/wordpress) before you sign up.<br>
:fa-check: Once you have signed up for WordPress (or contacted me if you cannot use WordPress), [start personalizing your site.](http://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/getting-started-with-wordpress/)<br>
:fa-check: Make sure you create an `edci335` category.<br>

!!!! **Important:** In order for your posts to be aggregated on the course blog, you need to send me your blog URL. Please do this in the ['Blog URLs' forum in CourseSpaces](https://coursespaces.uvic.ca). I have provided an example there.

### Self-Introductions

Now that you have set up your blog, please take a few moments to publish an introductory post on your blog. Tell me and your colleagues in the course a little about yourself as you feel comfortable sharing.

Please also include a brief story about one of your favourite learning experiences.

!!! Remember to use the category `edci335`.
