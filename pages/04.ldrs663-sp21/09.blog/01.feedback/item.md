We are approaching the half-way point of the course (at least in terms of new content), and you all have put in a significant amount of work to date. Thank you!

For those who have sent a link, I have added each of your blog feeds to the 'Blog Feeds' tab in Moodle, so you should see your posts starting to show up there. One thing you will notice is that in some cases (Genis' posts are a good example), there are posts from other courses showing up in the feed. The way to get around this is to ensure that you use the category 'ldrs663' or 'ldrs463' in all of your posts, then I will be able to subscribe to only those posts in that category. This also creates opportunity for you to organize your own site by course. Let me (Colin) know if you would like assistance getting this set up.

Additionally, I've read each of the posts that you have published so far and feel enriched for having done so. I appreciate the simplicity and versatility of [John Biggs' SOLO Taxonomy](https://teaching.madland.ca/solo)
