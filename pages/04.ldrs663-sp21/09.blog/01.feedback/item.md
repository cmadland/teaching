We are approaching the half-way point of the course (at least in terms of new content), and you all have put in a significant amount of work to date. Thank you!

For those who have sent a link, I have added each of your blog feeds to the 'Blog Feeds' tab in Moodle, so you should see your posts starting to show up there. One thing you will notice is that in some cases (Genis' posts are a good example), there are posts from other courses showing up in the feed. The way to get around this is to ensure that you use the category 'ldrs663' or 'ldrs463' in all of your posts, then I will be able to subscribe to only those posts in that category. This also creates opportunity for you to organize your own site by course. Let me (Colin) know if you would like assistance getting this set up.

One more thing you might notice is that some posts in the feed are accompanied by an image. I srongly encourage you to do this by including a 'Featured Image' in each of your posts.

Additionally, I've read each of the posts that you have published so far and feel enriched for having done so. I appreciate the simplicity and versatility of [John Biggs' SOLO Taxonomy](https://teaching.madland.ca/solo) (this is a link to a page I created primarily for my undergrad courses at UVic but it applies to graduate-level courses as well) in providing a structure for thinking about the quality of academic writing. Each of your posts has been very much in the `extended abstract` category of posts, which is to be expected for grad courses, well done! I particularly appreciated some of your criticisms of Anderson's *Interaction Equivalency Theorem*, as highlighted below.

As we continue into the second half of the course content, please make an effort to link to eahc others' posts. Doing so will create a network of ideas (which is what the web was built for...not cat pictures) that will help each of you deepen your understanding and consider other views as you write.

Thanks again for your work!

Colin
