## Topic 1: Social Theories of Learning

The idea that learning is a social process can be traced way back in time, but formal descriptions of social constructivism, as it has been called, are often traced to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky.

Modern conceptions of the learning process are based on the idea that knowledge is *constructed* by learners as they encounter new information, compare it to old models that they may have, and develop new understandings of how the world works. It is not the case that new knowledge is simply copied intact from one mind to another, rather new information is integrated into old, bringing about a hybrid of the two. This is essentially what we understand as a *constructivist* model of learning.

#### Zone of Proximal Development

Social constructivism is the idea that this process of integrating new understandings with old understandings is best understood as a *social* process. Vygotsky's model of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is helpful in understanding how this is conceptualized. The ZPD is the 'sweet spot' in education where a student is optimally challenged to learn. If the task is too easy for the student, and they have already mastered it, then learning activities will not result in learning. Conversely, if a task is so difficult that the student cannot complete it, even with assistance, learning activities will not result in learning. In the middle are tasks that a student is able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer or expert. This is the Zone of Proximal Development.

##### Teaching in the ZPD

Teaching with the ZPD in mind assumes that you, as the teacher, know what knowledge and skills your students are starting with. It is likely that the competencies that your students display fall along a bell curve. While most students will be in a similar ZPD, there will be outliers at both ends of the curve. One strategy can be to pair students whose skills and knowledge are below the curve with those above the curve. In doing this, students who are above the curve, who may not be challenged with the content or skill, have to engage in greater levels of cognitive complexity in order to concisely explain to their peer and help them to meet the objective. In my M.Ed. thesis (summarized in Madland & Richards, 2016) exploring a cooperative peer review activity, I asked participants how they thought cooperative learning activities supported learning. Their responses indicated that the two most important factors were *social cohesion* and *developmentally appropriate challenges*, indicating that they recognized the importance of the ZPD in learning.
