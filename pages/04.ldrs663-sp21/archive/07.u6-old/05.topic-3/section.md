## Topic 3: Practical Facilitation Strategies

The facilitation of courses in the TWU FAR Centre model is unique, as you know. From the perspective of a traditional, campus-based faculty member in Langley, a FAR Centre course is an *online* course. The faculty member has worked with an instructional designer to create a course which integrates everything required to create an online community of inquiry with allowances for all three presences: social, cognitive, and teaching presence. The courses are deployed through online technology and materials are accessed digitally in remote locations. Furthermore, students submit their work to the faculty member who then assesses their work and provides both formative and summative feedback as appropriate.

From the perspective of the remote student, however, the course is much more like a typical F2F course where they are meeting with a group of their fellow students in a central location and are guided through the learning materials by a more experienced 'other'.

The reason for this is that international students often  experience difficulties completing online courses from Western universities, so TWU is providing a F2F Academic Facilitator to assist remote students through the courses. You, as the Academic Facilitation Specialist, are a critical component of this model. Your skills in coaching students through courses and activities where you may not be a subject matter expert are going to be extremely important.

As such, you will need to start thinking about *how* to coach your students through some of the challenges of engaging in learning activities without the immediate F2F presence of a faculty member. In the activity below, you will read about a number of strategies that will help you facilitate TWU courses.  

`Also, perhaps we can add 1-2 more resources (videos, weblinks) that have practical facilitation strategies?`
