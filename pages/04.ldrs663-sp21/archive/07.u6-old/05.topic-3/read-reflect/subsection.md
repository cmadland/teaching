Keeping in mind that the book is written to address *blended learning* environments, and a FAR Centre isn't quite the same as a blended environment for the students, create a post on your blog to write about how this chapter and podcast would inform your work in a FAR centre. Please include something about how you can connect the ideas in the chapter to your past experience, either as a teacher, coach, student, or interested observer of one of those contexts.



Tag your post with `LDRS663` and `5.1`.
