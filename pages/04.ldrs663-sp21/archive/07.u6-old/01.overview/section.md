# Unit 6: Facilitating Cooperative Learning Activities
`connect practical ideas to theories in u1-4`

## Overview
Transformational learning at TWU is a profoundly social endeavour, much like many engaging learning environments. As a social species, we learn a great deal from each other in both formal and informal contexts. Our very earliest learning experiences are profoundly social and intimate interactions between mother and child, and the social aspect of learning never ceases to be important. During this unit, we will examine a short history of social theories of learning from John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, then we will spend some time experimenting with and learning about Liberating Structures.

## Learning Outcomes

* Design cooperative activities to maximize student-student and student-content interactions.
