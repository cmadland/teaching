### Learning Activities

#### Activity 7.1: GATHERING: Class meeting with Professor.

In this week’s conference meeting, your professor will provide a 40 minute talk
on conflict on harnessing the power of the team. The professor will include in
this talk two examples in his own life where leaders harnessed the power of the
team to accomplish great things and situations where the leader failed to
harness the power of the team and failed as a result.

Following the talk, the class will have an online discussion of the Teambuilding
Resources that were uploaded to the virtual campus in week 6. Following this
discussion, will be an opportunity for students to continue the discussion
online and to use the week 6 forum as a resource for their own team building as
leaders in the future.

This 1 hour online session will be recorded for future reference.

**Unit slides:**

In order to prepare for the meeting, you are invited to view the [Unit 7 Slides](https://gitpitch.com/TWUOnline/gitpitch-decks/master?grs=github&t=black&p=LDRS502-7). Your instructor
will go through this presentation during the gathering, so as you view the
slideshow, be sure to jot down notes and questions.

#### Activity 7.2: COMMUNITY BUILDING: Forum on Team Effectiveness 

For week 7’s Community Activity, we will follow up on the professor’s
illustrations during the gathering session. You will be asked to reflect on your
work in the past and find one example of good leadership that harnessed the
power of the team and one example of poor leadership that failed to harness the
power of the team. Please note that you should not use any identifying
information in your descriptions in order to ensure that other students in the
class cannot identify the members of your illustration.

Complete the questions as detailed in the assessment section of this unit. Note
that the interaction within this forum will play a part in your class
participation grade.
