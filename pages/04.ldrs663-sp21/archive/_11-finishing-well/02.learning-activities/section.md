### Learning Activities

#### Activity 1.2: GATHERING: Class Presentations.

For the final class for LDRS 502, we will select a 3-hour time block that is
convenient to the entire class near the end of week 10. During this 3-hour block
of time, each group will be given 30 minutes to present their course team
projects to the entire class.

The rules for the online presentations are listed below and the assessments
section of this unit:

1.  Each team has to use ppt, pdf, press, or some format that will organize
    their presentation for the class. The presentation needs to be uploaded to
    MOODLE at least 1 hour before the presentation in order to ensure there are
    no glitches during the zoom conference call.

2.  Each member of the team must play an active role in the presentation. They
    need to take some measurable and observable role in the presentation itself
    so the professor can grade their involvement.

3.  The presentations must be fully reflective of the Team based project
    completed throughout the 10 week online course.

4.  Presenters should be dressed and equipped for a formal presentation in the
    virtual space. Presenters should model the presentation as if they are
    presenting to the board of directors of the company or organization that has
    a problem or is looking to engage an opportunity

5.  The presentation should cover both aspects of the team process as well as
    the outcome of the team engagement related to the problem or opportunity.
    The structure for this should be about 1/3 of the time devoted to the team
    processes: Team Charter, Roles and Responsibilities, Conflict resolution
    structure, etc. and 2/3 should revolve around the organizational problem or
    opportunity, what research was conducted and what conclusions or directions
    are supported by the team.

6.  An appeal for change needs to be made to the class at the conclusion of the
    project.

7.  Presentations must conclude at the 30-minute mark or they will be cut off.
    There will be no tolerance for using other peopleâ€™s time for your
    presentation.

This 3-hour online session will be recorded for future reference.
