## Learning Activities

#### :fa-pencil: Learning Activity 4.1 - *Try Something New* Challenge

!!! ***Note:*** *This Learning Activity is intended to be **optional.** *If, however, you choose not to participate, it is strongly recommended that you read through the "Challenge" to understand how it "fits" into this topic.*

Begin this activity by following the link:

 - [**Try Something New Challenge**](http://anth101.com/challenge3/)

As you can see, in this activity, you are invited to learn a new skill over the next 28 days. It does not need to be an intensive skill, but it needs to be completely new for you. You might consider finding some tutorials on *Youtube* and learning to draw; Or maybe you want to learn an instrument; or learn to bake; or take better pictures; or arrange flowers. Pick something that will be relatively easy to practice, challenging to learn, and for which you will be able to see progress over 28 days. If you want some ideas or inspiration, check out the [28 Day Challenge](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/anth101challenge3/) on Instagram.

Note that for this course, you'll be learning a number of new skills, such as using GitHub (see Unit 3), so you may want to select that as your focus.

Feel free to share your learning, updating us on your progress and challenges. You are encouraged to upload media such as photos, video, or audio of your practice sessions. However, this is not a graded activity so this challenge should not be your priority if you donâ€™t have the time. Nevertheless, you should review this activity to familiarize yourself with it as an example of an engaging learning activity that can help learners, like yourself, become more aware of the nature of the human learning process.
