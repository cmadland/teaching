## Topic 2: The Practice of Coaching

***What is Coaching?*** Coaching is something that you do to help improve someone in some way. Gallway (1997) defines coaching as “a way of being, listening, asking, and speaking that draws out and augments characteristics and potential that are already present in a person.” His conceptualization of the method is analogous to Michelangelo’s approach to sculpture. Michelangelo believed that “every block of stone has a statue inside it and it’s the task of the sculptor to discover it.” Similarly, Gallway (1997) writes:

 ! *Coaches know that an oak tree already exists within an acorn. They have seen the one grow into the other, over time and under the right conditions, and are committed to providing those conditions to the best of their abilities. Successful coaches continually learn how best to “farm” the potential they are given to nurture.*

***How do Educators Coach Learners for Learning?*** The beginning point of an effective coaching for learning practice as an educator is the coaching relationship. It’s critical, according to Gallway (1997), for coaches to “[create] a safe and challenging environment in which learning can take place.” In the educator’s role as coach, this relationship is a shared learning space where the educator enters the learners’ internal dialogue with their learning experiences. Coaching work involves two aims, **(a)** helping each learner become aware of their own potential and **(b)** helping learners remove any interference in realizing this potential. In terms of coaching for learning we know that it is a natural aspect of our nature as human beings to learn. That is, it’s something we simply do naturally. But, one thing that makes learning difficult is that our past learning gradually starts to interfere with our present and future learning.

Increasing learners’ awareness of their own internal resistance to new learning is the primary theme of coaching for learning. Common obstacles to learning, according to Gallway (1997), include the learner’s assumption that they already know what is being taught, the fear of being judged, doubt, and trying too hard to appear learned. In broader terms, Scharmer (2016) has identified the learners’ internal ***voice of judgement*** (VoJ), ***voice of cynicism*** (VoC), and ***voice of fear*** (VoF) as universal factors interfering with learning. The role of effective coaching is to help learners overcome these obstacles by opening their mind, emotions, and will to new possibilities. This work involves coaching learners through the transition of change—that is, **(a)** letting go of what was, **(b)** moving through the transition, and **(c)** embracing a new beginning.  

The secondary theme of coaching for learning is increasing learners’ awareness of how they may best realize their potential capacity to learn anything which they set out to learn. This involves coaching learners in the learning process and helping them make it more effective and efficient. This practice builds on the notion of transforming the learners' natural learning process into a disciplined set of study skills. A helpful approach that educators can use to coach for learning potential is the GROW coaching model. This model is based on the coaching concepts pioneered by Gallway (1997) and developed at the McKinsey consulting firm in the 1980s and first published in 1992 by John Whitmore in his book *Coaching for Performance*. The model is widely used in leadership and life coaching contexts. For educators concerned with coaching for learning, we can apply this model in the following way:

 ! **[G]oal Setting.** *Helping learners clarify **what** they need and more importantly want to learn? **Why** they need and/or truly want to learn it? And **when** they need to, or genuinely want, to learn it? The coach, here, also helps learners see how their personal goals can align with prescribed learning outcomes.*

 !! **[R]eality Checking.** *Helping learners identify what they already know? What they can already do? What they have already done? What’s moving them towards their goal? And what’s getting in the way?*

 !!! **[O]ption Exploring.** *Helping learners identify the various options they have to move them toward their goals. Brainstorming what else they can do to achieve their goals? Assessing what are the benefits and weaknesses of the various options that they have identified?*

 !!!! **[W]ill be Doing.** *Helping learners choose which options to act on. Determining when to act on an option. Assessing how committed they are to taking action a given option? Committing to acting on an option.*
