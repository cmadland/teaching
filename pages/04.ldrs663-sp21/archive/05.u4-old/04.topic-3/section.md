## Topic 3: Core Coaching Competencies

Effective coaching is grounded in an emerging set of coaching competencies. These competencies represent a set of integrated knowledge, skills, aptitudes and attributes that coalesce into behaviors that define, in more detail, what is needed to successfully perform the task of helping learners learn. The following are six essential behaviors the developing educator as coach must demonstrate.

**Practicing Professional Ethics & Standards**

The basis of this competency is a personal commitment to demonstrating and maintaining the highest level of ethical behavior. Emerging professional coaching standards include, **(a)** making the roles, responsibilities, and rights of everyone involved in the coaching relationship clear, **(b)** clearly communicating how information will be communicated between everyone involved in the coaching relationship, **(c)** maintain confidentiality of personal information and communications, **(d)** having a clear understanding of the conditions where information will not be kept confidential, and **(e)** be aware of and respond sensitively to potential power or status differences.

**Cultivating Trust & Safety**

Seeks to understand the learner and their unique learning context, demonstrates respect for the learner’s identity, values and perspective, showing empathy and concern for their well-being, acknowledges the learner unique abilities, interests, and feelings, demonstrating openness and vulnerability, and supporting the unique needs of the learner’s personality.

**Holding Space/Presence**

Being focused on the moment and giving attention to what is occurring in your conversation with the learner. Initially, this might feel like simply holding yourself back from talking too much as the coach and giving the learner space (that is, your silence) to reflect and process things. One way to conceptualize this competency as "creating a “space to listen into.” This involves **(a)** creating comfortable distance in physical space, **(b)** creating a non-judgmental emotional space, and **(c)** creating a quite auditory space. Holding space, or being present, is an essential way the educator as coach can demonstrate to the learner that the learner’s contribution is valued and their learning is important. It’s also important for the coach to hold space for themselves to reflect and process what is happening.

**Active Listening**

The intent of these particular skills is to help the coach truly understand the learner and their context, and to help the learner feel like they have been understood and supported. Typical skills include, paying attention, holding judgement, reflecting, clarifying, summarizing, and sharing.

Invites learners to share more about their present learning experiences. Notices what is working to enhance the learners progress. Challenges learners to increase their awareness and insight.

**Cultivating Growth**

Asks questions that helps learners **(a)** surface their interests, **(b)** clarify and prioritize their goals, **(c)** assess their learning experiences, **(d)** explore options for continued learning, and **(e)** design learning plans and commit to achieving their learning goals.
