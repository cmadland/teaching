While much focus is often placed on 'teaching' learners through various media and modalities (lecture, labs, practical experience, inquiry), relatively less is placed on the details of assessing student learning and assigning a letter grade. Too often, assessment of learning is relegated to a couple (multiple-guess) midterm exams, a major paper, and a final (multiple-guess plus a few written answers) exam. The result of this is that learners become stressed out about the high-stakes testing and assessment of learning and their performance suffers, particularly when the stakes are already high, such as in competitive-entry programs.

In the TWU facilitated model, however, the intent is to essentially decouple `assessment` from `evaluation` for the benefit of learners. Your task as a facilitator will be to provide `formative` feedback, primarily on the `process` in which learners are engaging with the learning materials and activities. Over time, you will become more familiar with the content, and you will begin to understand some of the content enough to provide formative feedback there as well. The faculty who is the instructor of the course will be responsible for `summative` feedback.
