title: 'Peer Feedback'
---

An under-appreciated form of feedback is peer feedback, where a learner's peers provide feedback based on specific criteria. If you recall from Unit 6, there are several ways in which cooperative learning strategies like peer review can be effective.

Slavin found that, in addition to the social pressure for group members to help each other, there are cognitive benefits to both giving and receiving feedback from peers. For the learner giving feedback, there can be significant benefits from the processes of elaborating on explanations where the learner giving feedback needs to elaborate on their own understanding of the concept in order to explain it more clearly to their peer. Additionally, this models for the receiver how the giver thinks through the concept, giving them exposure to a wider variety of cognitive skills. The receiver also benefits from the provision of simplified explanations that are specific to their own concerns, from the ability to practice, and simply from receiving correction about their work.
