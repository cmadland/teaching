# Overview

Hattie and Timperley (2007) identified a model for effective feedback that provides the theoretical foundation for how to provide feedback and why feedback is so important for student learning and the attainment of learning outcomes through the use of high-level cognitive skills. They argue that feedback is among the top 10 influences on student achievement, but that the effect can be either positive or negative, leading to the conclusion that it is important to understand how to ensure the effect is positive.
