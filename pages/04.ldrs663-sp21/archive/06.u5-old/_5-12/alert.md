1. ***Who is the course for?*** Describe the target learners to whom the course will be offered. The instructors and/or your sponsor organization will provide you with this information. But, you should also add some of your own research.
2. ***How has COVID-19 impacted the learners in the course?*** Learners and faculty alike have been deeply impacted by coronavirus and COVID-19. How has that impacted learners in the course? Are they quarantined? Do they have access to technology at home? A quiet place to study? Are they looking after their children during the course?
2. ***What is the course about?*** Consider the course title, description, course learning outcomes, unit and topic titles, and in your own words try to summarize how you would explain to someone what this course of study is about?
3. ***What do learners need to know?*** Looking for patterns in the course materials and try to identify what you think are the three to five big ideas that the learners are expected to learn in this course?
4. ***What do learners need to do?*** Look at the learning activities and assessments to identify the performance-based tasks learners need to do. Specifically, focus on the tasks like forum posts and papers the learners need to produce something.
5. ***How do the learners complete the course?*** Determine if there is a critical path of task throughout the course. That is, are certain tasks contingent on one task being completed for another one can be done? Or is the path open-ended?
6. ***What challenges do you anticipate?*** Identify the specific challenges that you think learners may face as they work through this particular course of study. Do parts of the course look particularly difficult? Are any resources missing, or underdeveloped, or potentially difficult for certain cultural contexts to understand?

8. ***What questions do you have?*** If you could ask the course designer clarifying questions about the course, what would you want to know? What is unclear? What donâ€™t you understand? What are you curious to know more about?
