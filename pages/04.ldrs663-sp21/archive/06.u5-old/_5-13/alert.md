One trend that is gaining traction is **Multi-Access Learning.** Read the following excerpt from *Realigning Higher Education for the 21st-Century Learner through Multi-Access Learning* by Irvine, Code & Richards (2013):

Multi-access learning is an opportunity to meet both student needs for access to learning experiences and faculty needs for graduate student recruitment (Irvine, 2009; Irvine & Code, 2011, 2012; Irvine & Richards, 2013). Irvine defines multi-access learning as a *framework for enabling students in both face-to-face and online contexts to personalize learning experiences while engaging as a part of the same course.* Multi-access learning is different than blended learning because it places the **student at the center** of the learning experience as opposed to the instructor or the institution.

Further, "blended learning" is a problematic term due to its multiple interpretations in the literature and in daily practice, leaving one to ask, "Who controls the blend?" When and where the face-to-face sessions occur and when and how the online synchronous or asynchronous sessions occur are often controlled in blended learning settings. At the core, the institution or instructor is in control of the blend, no matter the configuration.

**Multi-access learning, however, has the learner at the center, with the ability to choose how he/she wants to access the course.** The core principle of the multi-access framework is one of enabling student choice in terms of the combination of course delivery methods through which the learning environment is accessed; that is, each individual learner decides how he/she wishes to take the course (e.g., face-to-face or online) and can then participate with other students and the instructor – each of whom have their own modality preferences – at the same time" (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).
