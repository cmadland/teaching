## Unit 5: Educational Experience in a Multi-Access World

### Overview

This unit investigates the nature of educational experience, and how to guide it within the emerging learning settings where the teaching presence is now being distributed across multiple modalities and instructional roles. In this emerging model there is a systematic division of labour of the traditional teaching responsibilities. For instance, in one emerging model of multi-access education the teacher designs a course and assesses the studentsâ€™ learning. However, the work of facilitating and directing the social and cognitive processes for the purpose of realizing the learning outcomes is now the responsibility of learning coaches and facilitators.
