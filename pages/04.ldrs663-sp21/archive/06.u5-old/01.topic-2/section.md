## Topic 2: What Makes a Learning Experience Educational?  

As course facilitator you must choose from different activities. You will need to decide which ones will best help each student achieve the course learning outcomes. In some cases, this decision will be based on what activities are most appropriate for a certain group of students, or perhaps even for a particular student. And in other cases, the decision will be necessary because there is not enough time to complete all the activities that have been set out by the course instructor/designer. You will also find yourself in situations that are teachable moments where how you facilitate student learning will have a significant impact on the degree and quality of student transformation. The question this discussion raises is how do you decide what is the best experience to facilitate learning in a given situation? To make good judgements requires a careful understanding of what makes an experience worthwhile.

For many, the concept of education is equivalent with schooling. However, as the American author Mark Twain famous quipped, “don’t let school interfere with your education.”  Twain, who was not educated beyond elementary school, was cynical towards the school system, believing that “education” is different from “schooling.” Indeed, he suggested, “Education consists mainly of what we have unlearned.” In other words, education involves the growth and transformation of a whole person. While a school may be a place we learn to read, write, and do arithmetic; to be educated, and hence, to have received an education suggests one becomes something.

In *Ethics and Education,* educational philosopher R. S. Peters (1966) argues that the term “education” has “normative implications.” That is, it suggests a worthwhile outcome is to be achieved:

> It implies that something worth while is being or has been intentionally transmitted in a morally acceptable manner. It would be a logical contradiction to say that a man (sic) has been educated but that he had in no way changed for the better, or that in educating this son (sic) a man (sic) was attempting nothing that was worth while. This is a purely conceptual point. Such a connection between ‘education’ and what is valuable does not imply any particular commitment to content. It is a further question what the particular standards are in virtue of which activities are thought to be of value and what grounds there might be for claiming that these are the correct ones. All that is implied is a commitment to what is thought valuable. (p. 25)

Peters’ (1966) assertion that the term education is more than merely a synonym for learning is surely correct, albeit uninformative. For learning is something that human beings simpley do regardless of whether it is of moral value or not. People naturally learn all sorts of things, including negative attitudes, defensive social skills, and various forms of misinformation, which are counterproductive to one’s identity, purpose, values and goals, or role in society. Thus, while an accurate definition, Barrow and Woods (2006) argue that Peters’ definition leaves two interesting and vitally important questions unanswered, “What are the worthwhile things which are to be transmitted?” and “How do we tell whether a manner of transmission is morally accepted or not?” (p. 30).

The “what” and “how” questions of education take us a step closer to understanding what it means to be educated. Broadly speaking, Peters’ assertion that education involves something of value being learned in a particular way implies that to become educated involves a transformation or a change. That is, to become educated means one becomes something. Consider, our common use of “to educate” in our everyday speech. When we say we must educate someone about something, such as, “We must educate the public” about such-and-such, “the clear implication of this familiar way of speaking is that certain information is to be imparted, this information is to be understood and, in virtue of the understanding, what people do, or do not do, is to change” (Barrow and Woods, 2006, p. 35). Thus, clearly education means not only coming to *know* such-and-such, but *how* to do various sort of things.
