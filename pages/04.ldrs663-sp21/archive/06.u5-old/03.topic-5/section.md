## Topic 5: Emerging Models of Open and Multi-Access Education

Online learning, blended learning, flipped classroom, face-to-face, hybrid course, multi-access... you may have heard some of these terms tossed around, especially recently with the shifting focus to online. Before we unpack and examine these modalities of learning, consider how learning in Higher Education has changed. *What are the shifts that have happened in the last 20, 10, 5 years? How has technology shaped the way teachers teach and the way students learn?*

*Source: Tiers of the multi-access framework (Irvine, Code & Richards, 2013).*

With the uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, multi-access learning has great potential for our education system. This modality not only brings more choice to students, but promotes a learner-centred course design and best practices in teaching and learning.

Read more about the 4 tiers of multi-access learning:

<details>
  <summary><b>Tier 1 - Click here to expand</b></summary>
    <p>The first tier of multi-access learning is what most of you have experienced (as learners and faculty) as the predominant modality of higher education, face-to-face (f2f). F2f learning environments are often assumed to be the preferred modality of learning because a f2f classroom allows for rich, multi-modal interactions and robust community-building. This is true to an extent, but only if class sizes are very small; large, lecture-based classrooms present significant challenges to building the kind of critical and safe community for engaged interaction.</p>

  <summary><b>Tier 2 - Click here to expand</b></summary>
    <p>The second tier of access allows learners who cannot travel to a central campus (like during a worldwide pandemic) to participate in a learning community syncronously via video conferencing. Remote and local learners may exchange items and artifacts and may share video feeds and use software such as Etherpad or screensharing through the web-conferencing tool to collaborate on documents for co-creation of content.</p>

  <summary><b>Tier 3 - Click here to expand</b></summary>
    <p>The third tier provides asynchronous access for remote learners who cannot join the scheduled class session due to any number of constraints (employment, child/elder care, time-zone, or even network bandwidth). Irvine, et al. acknowledge that simply viewing a recording of a synchronous session, regardless of how collaborative and engaging that session may have been, is a much leaner experience for learners and may not be optimal. This highlights the need to provide learning materials in formats beyond video and audio, perhaps including text-based materials and asynchronous tools for co-creation of content such as GitHub.</p>

  <summary><b>Tier 4 - Click here to expand</b></summary>
    <p>The outermost tier of the model is for open participation from non-credit learners who are choosing to participate for their own interest and edification. It may seem anathema to some faculty to consider opening their course to the world, but the benefits can be significant, particularly in times like the spring of 2020.</p>

So how does this Multi-Access model of learning compare to what you have experienced as an instructor? You may teach online, on campus, or have a blended approach in your courses. What are the key differences between these approaches and modalities?
