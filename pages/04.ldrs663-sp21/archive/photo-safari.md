### Learning Activity 3.4: Photo Safari Blog Post (...%)
```
Could we include that this is a graded activity that will be worth a certain percent?
```  

For your blog post this week, you are asked to complete a 12-picture Photo Safari on the theme of *learning*.
```
Does the text explain what a photo safari is?  If so, please provide the page number, or explain.
```

- Plan ahead and find a location where you can take pictures that symbolize learning in some way.
- Your first and last images will be of a clock (maybe screenshots from your phone) showing your beginning time and then your ending time 15 minutes later.
- Use some of the key points from your readings to inspire your images.
- Publish your photo safari on your site.
