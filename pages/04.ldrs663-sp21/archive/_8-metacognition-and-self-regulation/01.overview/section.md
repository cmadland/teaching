Unit 6: Negotiation, Power and Influence
========

## Overview

In Unit 6, we will cover types of power, power dynamics, social influence,
empowerment and group decision making. We will look at the definition of power
and how it relates to social influences and learn about the different types of
power and different influencing tactics that can be used to maintain, balance or
diffuse power differentials. We will see how power dynamics can influence and
affect a team and we will see the impact of interdependence on perceived roles
and contributions to group decision-making. Covering the benefits of
empowerment, degrees of empowerment programs and different approaches to promote
successful empowerment, we will also look at ways to encourage and apply
assertiveness. Focus will be placed on the value of group decision making,
advantage and disadvantage and when group decisions are superior to individual
ones. We will see different approaches to group decision-making such as
consultative, consensus and democratic approaches and the impact of emotions,
disagreements and negative pressures on making a group decision and how
different techniques can help with these conflicts.

It should be noted that misuse of power is one of the most damaging forces on a
team. When organizational leaders use their power to influence team members,
when team leaders use their power to bully or override team members and when
higher-ranking members of teams use their power to consolidate influence on a
team, trust across members is significantly impaired. More than this, the
members of the team (especially young members) learn through their experiences
how teams operate for the benefit of the organization. Emerging leaders take
their experiences on teams to either become more effective at building and
maintaining team trust in the future, or they will learn to use power, group
cohesion, blocks and silos, as ways to manipulate teams, they become
increasingly ineffective at leading teams toward organizational purposes.
Leaders have to constantly be vigilant for how their actions, words and
relationships impact others who are looking up to them for guidance on how the
organization should operate. Politicization and bureaucracy does not just happen
by accident any more than family dysfunction is a stroke of bad luck. The seeds
of organizational dysfunction and mistrust are won with every word, every team
engagement and every breach of trust that is made. The challenge is the impact
of our words and deeds rolls downhill. Dysfunction at the lowest levels in an
organization have an impact on a few people. Dysfunction at the top impacts
everyone beneath the leader. Dysfunction and power politics in the middle
affects large swaths of the organization and creates silos.

Teams communicate the values, intent and principles of the organization. Manage
them well and the organization is healthier, more functional, and more competent
to meet people’s needs and make their lives better. Manage them poorly and the
organization is weaker, more dysfunctional and less capable to meet people’s
needs and make their lives better.
