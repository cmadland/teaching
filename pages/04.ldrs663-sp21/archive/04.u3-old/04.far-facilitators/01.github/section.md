!!!! The following instructions are specifically for those in LDRS663 who are planning to become FAR Centre Facilitators. If this is not you, you are welcome to dive in and learn this workflow, but it may be less applicable than WordPress.

### Getting Set Up

We're going to take a little break from the so-called 'academic content' of this course and dive into some technical skills and digital literacies that you will need to succeed in a TWU microcampus. Keep in mind that the skills needed to use this workflow can be learned. It might take some more work for some of you than others, but you will all get there. Be patient. Ask for help from your colleagues and instructors. Be persistent. You've got this.

### GitHub


Throughout this course, we will be using a web application called GitHub to manage a large portion of your coursework. We also rely heavily on GitHub and the workflow that you will learn during this course to manage course materials that are ultimately displayed in Moodle or WordPress for students. GitHub is a web tool that allows distributed teams to cooperatively contribute to documents and to track projects. You might be familiar with Google Docs, which is a collaborative tool for creating and editing documents. GitHub shares some similarities with Google Docs, but there are also some important differences.

These differences will become apparent as you become familiar with GitHub, but for now, just keep in mind that GitHub doesn't have the same 'real-time collaboration' that you see in Google Docs, where multiple people can edit the same document at the same time and everyone can see everyone else's changes in real-time.

If this all sounds overwhelming, don't worry, we will walk you through each of the skills that you will need to navigate in GitHub.

### Why GitHub?

Good question! GitHub will admittedly require you to learn some new ways of thinking about and interacting with software. The lingo in GitHub and the interface might seem obtuse and unnecessarily 'jargony', but as you become more familiar with the capabilities and affordances of the tool, it will become second nature.

We are not using GitHub in order to make your life difficult! We are using GitHub because the structure of our organization requires robust technological infrastructure to manage our work, which is fundamentally decentralized with multiple interested users in different part of the world. For any given course, we will engage with the following groups and users:

- instructional designers
- subject matter experts
- editors
- production staff
- media producers
- librarians
- marketing and communications
- department administrators (Deans, Chairs)
- GLOBAL support staff
- university administrators (committees, Provost)
- teaching faculty (usually, but not always, the SME)
- Academic Facilitation Specialists
- Micro-campus administrators
- partner institution administrators, and of course,
- learners

This wide variety of stakeholders means that we need to be very intentional about how we manage our workflows.

### Using GitHub


GitHub and similar tools allow distributed teams to collaborate and track changes and versions of large, text-based repositories. Git, the software that is at the foundation of GitHub was created to manage the process of creating the Linux operating system, and it is now the industry standard for large software development projects.

One reason that Git is so good for large, distributed projects is that it preserves a record of every change that happens to a particular file and who made that change. It also keeps track of whose change happened when so that users can sort out any conflicts. It is admittedly a different workflow from what most people are used to, which is likely composing .xml files in MS Word (did you know you are composing XML files in MS Word?).

However, you are here to learn how to use Github, so let's get on with that.

First, there is some lingo that you need to become familiar with.

- repository (repo): a collection of files and folders, similar to how project folders are organized on your desktop
- clone: downloading all the files in a repo from GitHub (on the web) to your local computer
- commit: saving some changes to a repo
- push: sending changes to a repo from your desktop (local) to  GitHub (remote)
- fetch: checking to see if your local copy of a repo needs to be updated with new commits from the remote
- pull: updating your local copy with changes from GitHub
- fork: creating an exact copy of someone else's repo in your own account
- pull request: sending a request to the owner of a repo to merge your suggested changes with their repo.

It is ok if these don't make much sense right now, but they are a necessary part of a git-based workflow and they help to maintain structure and order in a project.
