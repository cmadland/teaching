### Optional Activity

I hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes?

[details="Click to open"]
:fa-book: Read [ Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171)  
:fa-image: Create your own Visitor-Resident Diagram of your web presence using the tool of your choice.  
:fa-share: Share your Visitor-Resident Diagram in a tool that falls into the 'Professional-Resident' quadrant for you and send me the link so I can add it to a feed. Include a short reflection on what your diagram tells you about your web presence. Feel free to interact with others' diagrams!  
:fa-share: Alternately, you can share a link in the Unit 4 Discussion forum.
