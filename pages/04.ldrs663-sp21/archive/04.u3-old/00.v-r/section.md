It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital 'natives' and 'immigrants'.

[details="Note"]
[Marc Prensky](https://marcprensky.com/), who proposed this idea, is the one who thought it would be a good idea to refer to people as 'natives'. We recognize that this term should not be used to talk about people.

The essential argument is that *kids these days* have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.

### Residents and Visitors

I'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where *you* reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it's a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else's blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor <--> resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal <--> professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).

I've shared my VR Diagram below...keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.

It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don't spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).

For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn't determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.

If you don't already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called *Teaching in Higher Ed* by [Bonni Stachowiak](https://twitter.com/bonni208), or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents.

A couple days ago one of the people I look up to as an educator published a blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit.
