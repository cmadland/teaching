### Unit 3: Teaching and Learning with Technology

There are some critical digital literacies that you will need to begin or continue to develop during this course. These skills and competencies that you will be developing are not intended to to be merely for the sake of learning so-called '21st-century skills' that are much ballyhooed in education circles. Rather, the unique structure of TWU microcampuses and the FAR Centre learning model require robust technological infrastructure to support our processes from initiating a course design project through the design, development, and production of learning materials and environments, to the ongoing maintenance and evergreening of courses deployed in widely diverse locations across the world. You will be required to interact with this infrastructure in order to access course materials; communicate with the faculty member responsible for the courses you are facilitating, as well as with administrative departments at TWU; participate in the process of localizing learning activities; and supporting the work of your fellow Academic Facilitation Specialists in other locations.

### Key Questions
- How can you maintain a connection to the greater TWU community?
- What role do you play in maintaining and revising learning materials and support resources?
