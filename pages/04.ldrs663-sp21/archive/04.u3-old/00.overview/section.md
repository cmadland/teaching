For the next two weeks, we will be exploring some technology tools that can help make the management of remote learning environments easier. As you know, there are two general cohorts of learners in this course, FAR Facilitators and generalists. Those of you on track to work as FAR Centre Facilitators will be asked to engage with the GitHub/Grav workflow, but if you are here from an outside organization, you may choose between the GitHub/Grav workflow and learning WordPress. Admittedly, WordPress has a much shallower learning curve, and it also will have much broader immediate applicability to other contexts.

We will be helping you set up an individual website in either Grav or WordPress that you can use as you continue with your studies.
