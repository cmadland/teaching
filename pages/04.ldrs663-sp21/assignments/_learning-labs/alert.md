#### Learning Labs (required but not assessed)

Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to attend learning labs. During lab times, the instructors will be modelling learning facilitation and coaching principles and skills. The instructors will be guiding group discussions, answering any questions you may have about the course, helping you understand your assignments, and giving feedback on your participation. The learning labs are not graded; however, lab learning is connected to the graded activities below.

> Note: Learning labs are scheduled for Wednesdays from 6-7:30 PM Vancouver time. Learning labs will be accessed synchronously via the Zoom video conferencing system.
