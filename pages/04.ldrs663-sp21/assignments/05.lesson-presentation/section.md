## Assignment 5: Lesson Presentation

Students will work in cooperation with an instructor in the TWU International Degree Completion program to plan and present a full or partial lesson (45-60 minutes).

`This is what I would do`
`demo a part of an activity as a lesson`

```based on our last meeting, should this include the following:
- present your lesson plan design, highlighting the theories discussed in the facilitation certificate
- teach a 1 5-10 minute activity, assuming your peers are FAR Centre students.

presentations may take place in a f2f class or in synchronous video conferences. Check with your instructor for details

```
