#### Learning Reflection Blogs (25%)

Throughout this course, you will be invited to write five “working” posts about what you are learning in this course. This will start with you posting to a Moodle Discussion forum, and then transition to your blog (to be introduced in Unit 3). You should consider your posts as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community. At the end of the course you will produce a *Showcase Post*, which will represent your best work. The showcase post will be the only graded post; however, your final grade will also consider how your ideas developed over the process of you writing five working draft posts.

Each of your draft posts should be 400-500 words.

#### :fa-calendar: Due at the end of Unit 1

#### :fa-users: Read and Discuss  
:fa-book: **Review** [Getting the mix right again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction](https://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/149/230) by Terry Anderson.  
:fa-book: **Read** [Interaction and the online distance classroom: Do instructional methods effect the quality of interaction?](https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.student.twu.ca/article/10.1007/s12528-011-9049-4)  by Heather Kanuka.  

Then, post a reponse in the *Unit 1 Forum* in Moodle - defending or criticizing Anderson's Interaction Equivalency Theorem. Ensure that you defend or criticize the idea, not the person, and include something that you have learned about interaction from somewhere other than the assigned readings.

:fa-birthday-cake: If your birthday is between January 1 and June 30, **defend** Anderson's Interaction Equivalency Theorem.

:fa-birthday-cake: If your birthday is between July 1 and December 31, **criticize** Anderson's Interaction Equivalency Theorem
