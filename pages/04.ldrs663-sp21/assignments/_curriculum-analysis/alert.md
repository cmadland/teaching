#### Facilitated Curriculum Analysis (10%)

Working together in your learning pod, you will examine the curricular resources that are, or could be, used with a facilitated learning approach. Emphasis will be placed on higher education courses and or programs of study. However, a range of other formats are open for investigation, including (but not limited to) community-based programs, professional certification programs, corporate workshops and training programs, and masterclasses. You will be invited to select a specific course of study and asked to assess the curriculum from a facilitation and coaching perspective.
