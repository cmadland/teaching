The image you see here was created in the early 20th century in France as a part of a series of images predicting what life would be like in 2000. You can see the full collection [**here**](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/).

As you can see, the artist envisioned a process whereby information was fed into a machine of some sort and just automagically downloaded into student minds. Kind of like this scene from the movie the *Matrix*:

These are both examples of how the modern condition of thought (Unit 2), has shaped our thinking about learning. Many modern era educators viewed people as learning “machines” who could be “programmed” with instructions, just like we program computers. The legacy of this thinking still lingers and the educational model of instructors instructing students through instructions is still prevalent.

In these modern visions, learning is something done *to* students, not something done *by* students. The learner is completely passive in the process. The dreams of grade-schoolers to be able to rest a book on their head and learn by osmosis are just as far-fetched as the prognostications from the early 20th century, from the *Matrix,* and from the claims of many edtech companies today. However, we need to recognize that learning is hard work. Consider Erasmus’s (1965) comment in his dialogue *The Art of Learning*, “For my part, I know no other art of learning than hard work, devotion, and perseverance” (p. 461). This statement remains as true today, as it was in 1529.

Take a few minutes to watch this video from Destin Sandlin, creator of the YouTube channel *Smarter Every Day*. The video has a long introduction, but it is entertaining and sets up the problem of learning very well:

Destin talks about some important ideas related to pedagogy (the study of how children learn) that are also applicable to andragogy (the study of how adults learn). One of those ideas is that *knowledge != understanding* (and now you know that the '!' negates the '=' in that statement). A little later in this unit, when we talk about deep and surface approaches to learning, we will come back to this idea.

!!! As a way to consolidate your own learning around this concept, take a few minutes to think about a time when you have had knowledge, but not understanding, and how that affected you in some way. You don't have to write anything down, just connect the idea to an experience that you have had.

In the video, Destin also talks about cognitive bias and the tremendously powerful effect that our own biases have on what and how well we learn. The challenge that he faced in learning to ride the backwards brain bike wasn't so much the physical skills involved, but *unlearning* his previous 'ride a bike' algorithm. When he encountered new information that didn't match his previous experience, it was extremely difficult to overcome his previous experience and bias. It took him 8 months of dedicated effort to do it. At the end, he discovered that he hadn't *overcome* his bias, he had only transferred it to a new bias, albeit one that was easier to overcome.

This process is also true for people learning new ideas. None of us come to a learning context without preconceived ideas regarding the nature of the topic to be studied, and often, those ideas are incorrect. They are misconceptions. Biases. Then, when new information comes along, our brain actively sabotages us by telling us that we already know this and we don't need to listen, while simultaneously convincing us even more of the truth of our misconceptions.

Below is another video, this time from *Veritasium,* in which Derek Muller shows why misconceptions (biases) can be so difficult to overcome:

Despite the difficulty, it is important to note that we *can* overcome these biases and misconceptions. In fact, we can overcome some bizarre inputs, as [researchers have discovered and was briefly reported in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down).

Here is a slightly less scientifically rigorous portrayal of what happens when our vision is artificially flipped: (The video is 12 minutes, but you don't need to watch it all).

The point of these experiments, at least for our purposes, is that human brains (and likely other animals as well) demonstrate the characteristic of *plasticity*. The connections in our brain that allow ideas to form and be adjusted can be broken and then reconnected in different configurations.

***This is learning. Learning is hard work.***

One implication of this is that it is naïve for educators to assume that a single exposure to an idea will somehow cause learning. In fact, the opposite is true. It takes repeated exposure, practice, error-correction, and adjustment for learning to become consolidated.
