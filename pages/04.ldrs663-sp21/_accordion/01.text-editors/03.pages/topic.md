### Pages (macOS)

Pages is the default word processing software on macOS and comes bundled with all new Apple computers. Apple has simplified Pages over the years and learners who use Pages to create their documents need to export them to Word or PDF before submitting them as Pages documents cannot be opened on Windows or Linux computers.
