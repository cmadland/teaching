### Students

One excellent reminder from the SECTIONS model is that students are always the priority when thinking about technology, or, to be more precise, we need to start thinking about technology in education by thinking about what learners will `do` to meet the outcomes.

Shuell (1986) states the point nicely

> If students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacherâ€™s fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. It is important to remember that `what the student does is more important than what the teacher does`. (p. 429) (emphasis added)

Practically, that means that our recommendations should come from what you want your learners to be doing, and we don't know that yet, so we have made some assumptions based on some of the things that we know help learners learn. I (Colin) think it is safe to assume that faculty at TWU generally want learners to engage in activities that reflect higher order cognitive skills (evaluating, applying, creating, building, imagining, interpreting, and yes, even understanding) as opposed to lower order cognitive skills (remembering, recognizing, duplicating, recalling, stating). This is most likely evidenced in your learning outcomes, and it is certainly [reflected in the TWU Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes).

So, before you think about using any given tool, please consider what you want learners to do. For example, if you want learners to interact with each other, how can you do that in a remote, asynchronous environment? What tools should you use? Is Zoom interactive with 4 people in a session? Is it interactive with 20 people? 100 people?
