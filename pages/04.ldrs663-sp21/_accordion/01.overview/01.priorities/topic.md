### Priorities

Before recommending any specific apps for use in your courses, it is worthwhile to outline some priorities that we maintain with respect to our recommendations.

### SECTIONS

Tony Bates describes the SECTIONS Model for choosing technology or media in Teaching in a Digital Age.

The acronym stands for different considerations that come into play:

- Students
- Ease of use
- Cost
- Teaching functions, including pedagogical affordances of media
- Interaction
- Organizational Issues
- Networking
- Security and privacy


The SECTIONS model is useful for thinking about technology at a macro level, but taken as a whole, it may not be terribly practical in an instructor's everyday practice.
