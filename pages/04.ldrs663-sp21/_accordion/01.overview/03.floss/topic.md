Actually, not that floss...

Free/Libre Open Source Software has been a TWU priority for a long time as evidenced by our long-term use of Moodle as our learning management system.

There are very good reasons to prioritize FLOSS, even beyond the cost. Software like Moodle and WordPress have huge developer communities behind them because they are customizable and extensible with a huge ecosystem of plugins that provide functionality beyond what is available in the core.

This also means that there is no particular company that can disappear, leaving users high and dry. WikiSpaces is an example of a software company that attracted a huge number of educators and institutions to use its services, [then they quit.](https://wikispaces.com/) Knewton is another example. Here are two articles:

The second is from less than 5 years after the NPR article.

Not only is there a risk of small companies going out of business and leaving users stranded (this has happened at TWU), but there is also the issue of using proprietary tools that only produce files in their own proprietary formats.
