### SOLO Taxonomy

In light of the presumptive goal of higher order cognitive activities, the SOLO Taxonomy is a tool that can be used to evaluate the quality of a given learner's or group's response to a provocation. SOLO is an acronym for Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, and it defines various levels of responses, as follows.

Here is another conceptualization of the SOLO Taxonomy:

If learners are providing responses at a `pre- or uni-structural` level in a university course, they are going to have a bad time. `Multi-structural` responses will likely lead to grades in the 'C' range. At minimum, responses should be `unambiguously relational` for a grade in the 'B' range and `extended abstract` for a grade in the 'A' range.

The [TWU Standard Grading System describes 'A' work as](https://www.twu.ca/about/university-standard-grading-system)

>Outstanding, excellent work; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.)

For a 'B', here is what learners need to do:

> Good, competent work; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.

### Ummm...I'm here for the tools...

Here is a good place to start...not with particular tools, but with particular activities.

Stanford's matrix is getting plenty of traction in this time when so many are relying on Zoom to deliver content.
